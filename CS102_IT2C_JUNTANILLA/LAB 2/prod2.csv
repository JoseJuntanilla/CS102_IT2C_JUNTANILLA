After trying various other brands, this for me is by far the simplest to use... Not too many interruptions like some do... Prompts etc... Just install and away you go.  Always remember to uninstall any existing virus software to save midday stopping advising you to do Just that.Although I have used this for years, this is the first time of buying via Amazon and after comparing prices elsewhere, the prices are very much the same (other then directly from company which is way much higher!).  If the pricing stays competitive, I will certainly buy next time.The software itself is do easy to install... From buying to installing it is a matter of a few clicks on the computer... No waiting around for the post to arrive or an email with an attachment etc... Straightforward from the off.I have never had any issues with viruses etc whilst using McAfee and use my computer worry free.Definitely recommend and a great, but realistic price point too!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 June 2023"

Easy to navigate the menu. However, it has one quite annoying feature I have to put up with, every time when you use VPN it turns your own default searching engine (Google, in my case) into MA's own 'safety search' sponsored by Yahoo. You can manually switch it off in the browser settings, but doing it every time you use VPN ( and I use it frequently) is a pain in the neck. Apart from that it's a good safe piece of software.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2023"

No complaints after 2 months of running in on multiple machines.  BD had more features such as PC Optimisation,  which are paid add on for McAfee. However, so far never had AV hogging 100% cpu, which was rather common in BD. This certainly is a better /smarter AV imo.This version of McAfee also has unlimited VPN as standard as opposed to megerly 200mb daily limit on BD per device.Overall, excellent","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 February 2024"

If I were given to know this from the production description, I would have bought Norton, which Amazon advertises as auto renew is required. This is an unfair campaign with unequal disclosure.

Black Friday this, Cyber Monday that, renewal other. The best I could see was £39 to renew and that is quite a significant amount more than McAfee.Reviews show them neck and neck in their abilities and as a savvy IT user I don't visit dodgy websites anyway so it's by the by.I have therefore decided to go for McAfee for 2024 and ditch Bitdefender.I'll update my review once I have used it for a bit and see how effective it is.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2023"
