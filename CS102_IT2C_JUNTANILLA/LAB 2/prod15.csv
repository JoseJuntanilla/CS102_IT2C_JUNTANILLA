"1","Kraken Black Cherry and Madagascan Vanilla Black Spiced Rum 70cl","4.8 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Snowy","I am a big fan of a dark and stormy - a generous measure of Kraken into a fiery ginger beer, garnished with lime.  A litre bottle means more dark and stormies, so that's automatically a Good Thing.It is also regularly discounted, so can be a real bargain on here.  My favourite spiced rum in a decently sized bottle is always a five star review!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2024"

"5","Kraken Black Cherry and Madagascan Vanilla Black Spiced Rum 70cl","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","mr a j h symons","I like a quality rum even though I'm not a frequent drinker - more of a 'tippler' if the word exists and my previous purchase of Woods rum was I thought, my favourite but this is a different flavour altogether and even more palatable. I'd say it's now become my new favourite, particularly as it's a litre bottle. and was at a good price when I bought it. It's a pity the price increased by almost £10 a few days after as I'd have bought another for the future but glad I got a bargain..","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 February 2024"
