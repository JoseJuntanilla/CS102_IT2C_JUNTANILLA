"1","Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl, ABV 40% - Ideal partner in Old Fashioned Cocktail","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Sean","I actually think this is one of the best spirits out there. Price wise for me it's at the top. It hits the right notes, the hint of vanilla, slight charred oak finish, a smoothness that lingers. I've even had the pricier stuff from the buffalo trace distillery and although they're also phenomal, they just get out classed due to the price ratio.For a bit extra fun, when ever I drink scotch I always compare it to buffalo trace. Being from the UK I have easy access to very good scotch in any average bar. I have yet still to find something that beats this whisky (whiskey to my American friends)","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2023"

Jack Daniels tastes just mouldy to me!  This had a variety of levels of flavour, and is reviewed well by bourbon experts.  It's very much like a more expensive drink.  Smooth, and slightly sweet from the corn.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 February 2024"
"9","Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl, ABV 40% - Ideal partner in Old Fashioned Cocktail","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Tony","Taste has really grown on me. Like to drink a little of this neat of an evening and at first, I wasn't too taken with it after last drinking Bulleit Bourbon. This at 40% came over a little more strong tasting [Bulleit was 45%] but now getting different taste experience with this and even prefer this slightly if anything. Would buy again and is nice to drink straight. Not yet tried mixed but I am peculiar with whisky, not really liking with American, lemonade or water. Would recommend and buy again if on offer.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2024"
