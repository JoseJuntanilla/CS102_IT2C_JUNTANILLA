"1","Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter 20L","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","JackB","Good litter. Cat seems to like using it. I have a mat under the tray to catch the odd bit that comes off on the cats feet. It seems to hold the smell although I do replace frequently. Not too expensive for a large bag!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024"
"2","Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter 20L","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","KJ","Really good product, been buying cheap litter for years and always had an issue with odours, not with this one though, doesn’t clump together, meaning you can easily scoop out solids and is very long lasting because of not having to constantly remove large amounts of clumped litter, so actually works out cheaper in the long run.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 January 2024"
"3","Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter 20L","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","JackB","Very absorbent, doesn’t all clump into a lump , reduces odour , not noticed ANY cat wee smell and we have three litter trays dotted around the house for two very young kittens, we all know cat wee is a horrible strong odour! Highly recommend","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024"
"4","Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter 20L","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Tracey","Excellent product, worth the extra cost to me as I have COPD so this saves a lot of tiring effort for me. However, unfortunately the company used Hermes to deliver.  My local (Evri) agent will not ring the front door bell but instead insists on going past the front door and bell, round the side of the house and leaving packages, whatever the weather, round there for me to discover, sometimes days later.  This time, I found the package but it's too heavy for me to carry to my door so I'll have to wait for someone to come who can carry it for me.  This undoes the benefit of buying cat litter in this form and in bulk so unless supplier changes delivery company, that's it for me.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2024"
"5","Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter 20L","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","M. Burrows","I recently tried out the Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter, upon a friend's recommendation. As someone who has been using regular Catsan litter for quite some time, I was excited to give this new product a whirl. However, after using it for a while now, I have mixed feelings about its performance.Firstly, let me start by highlighting the positives. The Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter does an excellent job in terms of odor control and clumping ability. It effectively keeps any unpleasant smells at bay, leaving my home smelling fresh and clean. The clumps formed are tight and easy to scoop up, making the cleaning process hassle-free. This aspect alone earns it a decent rating of 4.However, when considering the price difference between the Catsan Smart Pack and their regular litter, I must admit that I am slightly disappointed. While I had hoped that the Smart Pack would last longer due to its unique design and packaging, I found that it didn't live up to my expectations in terms of longevity. Considering the higher price tag, I expected it to be more cost-effective in the long run. Sadly, this was not the case.Another drawback worth mentioning is that these smart packs do not fit all types of cat litter trays. If you have a standard rectangular tray with no raised sides or unusual shapes, then you're good to go. However, if your tray deviates from this norm in any way, you may encounter difficulties fitting the Smart Pack correctly.Overall, while there are certainly positive aspects to highlight about the Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter such as its superior odor control and clumping ability, I personally feel that it falls short when considering its value for money compared to regular Catsan litter. Additionally, the limited compatibility with certain cat litter trays can be quite inconvenient.So, despite giving it a rating of 4 out of 5 due to its positive attributes mentioned earlier, I have decided that I won't be purchasing the Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter again in the future. Instead, I will stick to the regular Catsan litter that has served me well and offers better value for my money in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2024"

"8","Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter 20L","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","susan baker","As a proud owner of four feline friends, finding a litter that effectively combats odours has been a game-changer, and Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter has done just that. Its exceptional absorbency keeps the litter box fresh, significantly reducing the dreaded cat poop smell. It's easy to maintain, making our daily cleaning routine much simpler. Despite its slightly higher price, the quality and quantity provided offer great value. Plus, its minimal dust production is a bonus for our respiratory health.

"9","Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter 20L","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Shug","The best liners I’ve used to far! They fit many different sizes of tray and don’t hold a smell. Much more sturdy than other litter liners I have tried, which often rip and tear but these hold up great against claws. This helps when cleaning as it’s easier to remove the bag as it’s all in one piece and there aren’t holes for pee and other substances to leak through, making cleaning that much easierOnly thing I would suggest is you might need to buy another normal bag just to top it up a bit, depending on the size of tray you use. 4kg is a bit thin of a layer for my tray but it is a large one so I buy a 10kg bag on top and throw an extra kg or so on top when I change the litter","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"

Despite its slightly higher price, the quality and quantity provided offer great value. Plus, its minimal dust production is a bonus for our respiratory health. Highly recommend for anyone with multiple cats looking for a stress-free litter solution!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2024"
"49","Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter 20L","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Shug","The best liners I’ve used to far! They fit many different sizes of tray and don’t hold a smell. Much more sturdy than other litter liners I have tried, which often rip and tear but these hold up great against claws. This helps when cleaning as it’s easier to remove the bag as it’s all in one piece and there aren’t holes for pee and other substances to leak through, making cleaning that much easierOnly thing I would suggest is you might need to buy another normal bag just to top it up a bit, depending on the size of tray you use. 4kg is a bit thin of a layer for my tray but it is a large one so I buy a 10kg bag on top and throw an extra kg or so on top when I change the litter","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"
