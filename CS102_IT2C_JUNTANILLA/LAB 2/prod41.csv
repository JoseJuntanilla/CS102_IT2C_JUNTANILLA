"1","Throw Throw Burrito Card Game by Exploding Kittens - A Dodgeball Card Game - Fun Family Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids, 2-6 Players","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Starry night","This game is absolutely bonkers – and a lot of fun. It’s beautifully presented – the game comes in a nicely made, rigid storage box that should last well. If I’m being really critical, it is a bit overpackaged, although most of the internal packaging (barring cellulose wrapping around two decks of cards) is made from paper or card. The avocados are really cute: with friendly, smiling faces and slightly bugging eyes. There are decent elements of realism too: the avocado halves are pretty much the right size for a real avocado, and one half has the stone in it, whilst the other has a hole. The two would fit together neatly, were it not for their eyes! The avocados are designed to be thrown at other players: they’re made from coated foam and are soft, squishy, and completely safe. Far less sting-y than ball pit play balls can be!The game itself is total pandemonium, in which pretty much everything you know and expect from the structuring a board/card game… gets thrown out the window. Dealing is haphazard, as is game play. The rule booklet encourages you to watch a video instead of reading the rules. There are no clear turns. The game is designed to create a mess of cards dumped in other players’ draw pots, instead of neat, structured piles. It’s fast, furious, hilarious… and you get to repeatedly throw squishy toy avocados at people. Loved it!There’s a clever bit of marketing involved, too. The game is a sequel to ‘Throw Throw Burrito’, and includes an add-on extension game that can only be played in conjunction with the burrito game. The manufacturers make this hard to ignore: there’s a paper envelope of cards that you’re instructed NOT to open as it contains an expansion that can only be used in combination with ‘Throw, throw burritio’. I’m contrary enough to have followed the instructions here, and have not opened the envelope. At time of writing, we do not own ‘Throw, throw burrito’ – and unless one of our friends owns a set we can borrow, I think it’s safe to say that by Christmas we will have invested in the original game, because I think this will be a lot of fun if a family Christmas is back on the cards in 2021.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2021"

"4","Throw Throw Burrito Card Game by Exploding Kittens - A Dodgeball Card Game - Fun Family Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids, 2-6 Players","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Starry night","This review is based on two adults and two 12 yr olds playing - we found the rules easy to pick up after a couple of read throughs of the instructions. It's a bit like a fast paced game of ""go fish"" with added chaos. Everyone enjoyed the game - including the adult who'd had to have their arm twisted to join in. There were soon shrieks of laughter from everyone as the shouts of ""burrito war!"" etc went out and we scrambled to hurl our missiles at each other (very soft, don't hurt) and dive for cover. The games don't last long so you don't have to commit to hours if you don't feel like it, but equally you can keep playing for as long as the fun lasts. If you don't want an opportunity to throw things at your family without reproach, this probably isn't for you. If you like a laugh, it probably is.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 December 2023"

The games don't last long so you don't have to commit to hours if you don't feel like it, but equally you can keep playing for as long as the fun lasts. If you don't want an opportunity to throw things at your family without reproach, this probably isn't for you. If you like a laugh, it probably is.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 December 2023"

Grad","This game apparently has some rules, and there may be a strategy.However, in practice, you just slam cards down as fast as you can until you or someone else yells something, and then you throw a burrito at them, or at someone else, or you command others to throw burritos at each other.Sometimes you run around a whole building trying to either throw or evade a burrito. Sometimes you just pray to have a burrito slammed into your face and be done with it.You can console yourself from the trauma by using resting burritos as useful stress relief toys.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2023"
