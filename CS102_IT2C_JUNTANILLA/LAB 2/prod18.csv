"5","Old Pulteney 12 Years Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky, 70cl","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Tony M","Full disclosure: This review might be a bit biased because Old Pulteney 12 Years happens to be my absolute favourite whiskey. Its well-balanced and easy-drinking nature, coupled with the delightful notes of honey, citrus, and a subtle maritime influence, make each sip an incredibly enjoyable experience. The 12 years of aging truly shine through, adding a depth and complexity that I find unparalleled. For fellow enthusiasts who appreciate a finely crafted and time-honored Scotch whisky, Old Pulteney 12 Year is a must-try and, dare I say, a must-have in any collection. Cheers to savoring moments with this exceptional dram!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2024"
"6","Old Pulteney 12 Years Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky, 70cl","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","M. Salvona","Love this Malt. This is a smooth Highland Malt similar to a Speyside as opposed to a peatiy Islay. Lovely just to sit back and sip on a dram of this. And if you're partial to something sweet now and again, try the liqueur version, Stroma. Simply the best malt.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 October 2023"
"7","Old Pulteney 12 Years Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky, 70cl","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Adam","I was worried about the bottle smashing during transit but I shouldn’t have been. Very robust cardboard box. I tasted this whisky years ago and the name has always stuck in my head. Wonderfully smooth taste. I cannot stress that enough. Very underestimated brand. That afterburn you get from cheap blended stuff (which puts people off whisky in the long run) is not an issue with this. Really cool eccentric bottle which resembles a still. Best served with ice. Very good value for money. A great present for family or just treat yourself. I am going back for another glass now.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2024"
