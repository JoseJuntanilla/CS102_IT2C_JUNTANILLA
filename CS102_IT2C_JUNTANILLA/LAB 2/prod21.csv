By performace I mean how absorbent the tissue is and the thickness so that it doesn't tear easily.The great thing by getting them on Amazon is that you can buy the really large packs, and multiples of them, so you get the best value for money and you don't have to worry about whether they will fit in your car or not because these get delivered to your doorstep - and for free if you are a Prime member like I am.Amazons price for these is excellent and it worts out cheaper than the supermarkets. That combined with the fact that you don't have to worry about carrying these large packs home, makes Amazon the ideal place to buy these.As mentioned earlier, the Andrex toilet rolls are really good, but the reason why I only gave these 4 stars instead of 5, is because over time it looks like the manufacturer has reduced the actual size of the rolls so that you end up with less toilet paper on them. I can remember the rolls being a lot thicker in the past, but nowadays it looks like most manufacturers are trying to scrimp and save whereever they can, hence the reason for me giving these 4 stars.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2023"

"7","Andrex Gentle Clean Toilet Rolls - 45 Toilet Roll Pack - Bulk Buy Toilet Rolls - Gentle and Soft on Your Family's Skin - Dermatologically Tested","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Andrea","This is the second time I have made the mistake of buying the wrong Andrex.  I didn't want the Gentle Clean, ""puppies on a roll"", type I wanted the traditional.  The first time was recently, with a supermarket purchase.  Andrex are producing so many different types of toilet roll but they are all good value.I have tried some of the other types, including the aloe vera ones for when I have visitors of the feminine kind.Even though I purchased the wrong type again, I do not mind as this puppies on a roll Andrex is good quality, soft and absorbant.  The reason I do prefer the traditional one is because the traditional one is also a good all rounder and can be used as kitchen roll, cleaning windows etc.  Anything tissue paper does, the traditional one is good at.This pack of 45 rolls is good value for money as even when Andrex is on offer in the supermarkets one can't find 45 rolls for this price.Now for the bit where some buyers are complaining that these are not real Andrex, they are fake, they are shorter, smaller than the ones they normally buy etc.  Sorry to say but they are wrong.  These rolls have not changed in size or thickness.  This is the standard size for the Gentle Clean (puppies on a roll) paper.  The ones I actually wanted, before making the same error again, are the traditional ones and they do have more paper on them and the sheets are larger but for this type of Andrex it is the correct size.  The paper is actually softer than the traditional paper and that is where the smaller size comes into play.  This is more costly to produce.  People claiming it is fake or Andrex have downsized etc. can just as easily buy much more newspaper for the same price but they certainly will not get the softness with it.  These are the genuine Andrex Gentle Clean rolls and they have not been downsized.I am highly recommending this 45 pack of Andrex Gentle Clean (puppies on a roll) as it is much better quality than the traditional one, it is much softer and so it is highly suitable for the bathroom / WC.  It's just not quite as good for some other uses such as cleaning windows as the fibres come loose and stick to the window.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2024"

I like it. It’s soft and lasts a long time.I was kind of hoping after putting a roll onto the wall mounted holder the correct way, you know… flap hanging outside not wall side (who does that?) that if I closed the door and waited a while then came back excited like a small child on Christmas morning I would be welcomed by some cute puppies eating the butt napkins and making a total mess of my bathroom but when I returned i was only welcomed by my toddler asking for help 🥹 wondering if I got the wrong pack.

I didn't want the Gentle Clean, ""puppies on a roll"", type I wanted the traditional.  The first time was recently, with a supermarket purchase.  Andrex are producing so many different types of toilet roll but they are all good value.I have tried some of the other types, including the aloe vera ones for when I have visitors of the feminine kind.Even though I purchased the wrong type again, I do not mind as this puppies on a roll Andrex is good quality, soft and absorbant.  The reason I do prefer the traditional one is because the traditional one is also a good all rounder and can be used as kitchen roll, cleaning windows etc.  Anything tissue paper does, the traditional one is good at.This pack of 45 rolls is good value for money as even when Andrex is on offer in the supermarkets one can't find 45 rolls for this price.Now for the bit where some buyers are complaining that these are not real Andrex, they are fake, they are shorter, smaller than the ones they normally buy etc.  Sorry to say but they are wrong.  These rolls have not changed in size or thickness.  This is the standard size for the Gentle Clean (puppies on a roll) paper.  The ones I actually wanted, before making the same error again, are the traditional ones and they do have more paper on them and the sheets are larger but for this type of Andrex it is the correct size.  The paper is actually softer than the traditional paper and that is where the smaller size comes into play.  This is more costly to produce.  People claiming it is fake or Andrex have downsized etc. can just as easily buy much more newspaper for the same price but they certainly will not get the softness with it.  These are the genuine Andrex Gentle Clean rolls and they have not been downsized.I am highly recommending this 45 pack of Andrex Gentle Clean (puppies on a roll) as it is much better quality than the traditional one, it is much softer and so it is highly suitable for the bathroom / WC.  It's just not quite as good for some other uses such as cleaning windows as the fibres come loose and stick to the window.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2024"
