"2","Dumb Ways to Die Card Game Based on the Viral Video, Card Games for Adults | Party Games | Adult Games | Fun Games, for Families & Kids Ages 12 and up","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Liz","This is a fun little card game. My 10 year old loves the song so I got this for him for a Christmas present. We are serious board gamers and he's used to playing games with more complex rules (worker placement, engine builders etc) but I thought that this would be a nice short easy to play game. It's pretty fun as we've already played it 3 times in one sitting. It is a 'take that' game with player elimination, so for me it was more fun with just 2 players. However it's not as mean as Munchkin and the lenticular cards are darkly humorous as you kill off the beans. My son loves the cartoon illustrations and it's great to pick up and play for a few minutes to get your kid off devices. The photo shows the least gruesome 'you died' card I could find but it's cartoon humour with 'beans' instead of people so we like it. We'll be keeping and playing this one as our non-gamer friends will find the rules easy and the illustrations are great. Also it plays up to 5 people so will work for a larger group. The lenticular cards do warp over time but apparently that's not unusual and doesn't affect gameplay. The quality is lovely with linen finish on the playing cards, a custom die amd moulded insert which was a nice surprise.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2023"

It is really simple to play and goes pretty quick once you understand the rules. It's easy for pretty much anyone to play. We have an autistic child and a brain injured adult in our family and they got the hang of it after a round of two.
