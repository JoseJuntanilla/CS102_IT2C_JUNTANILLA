I like the fact they don't sting. If you've ever wondered why your baby girl cry's when you use baby wipes to clean their bits..it's coz most wipes sting like heck! They don't have perfume in or alcohol they are water. And now these wipes don't have plastic in them..they are better for the planet. Most wipes do still have plastic in them and if you dig those up in 50yrs time they will still be recognisable as baby wipes. Bad for the planet, bad for animals on land and sea(PLEASE DONT FLUSH WIPES DOWN THE LOO. THEY DON'T DISSOLVE. NO WIPES DO. causing blockages in sewer pipes ND harm at sea. Thank you.) These wipes don't leave your skin feeling sticky when you're skin is cleaned. So BIG bonus. Only problem I have is that the wipes don't come out of the packet easy. If the big brand most used(in UK anyway) can make each wipe follow on from the last when pulled out. Why can't you, or a lot of other makes for that matter. I have to fiddle around trying to find the end of the next wipe without either ripping the wipe or pulling a lot of them out at once coz i need them quickly and then trying to stuff the ones not used back in the packet or wiping surfaces with them just to use them but then I run out of wipes for the purpose I need them. Most annoying ND expensive. Which no-one needs right now.This is the only fault with them tho' it is a pain in emergency's. I will keep buying this brand coz they are not expensive, don't sting, don't leave sticky residue and don't contain plastic in the wipes(the packet obviously is plastic). I would recommend for these reasons. Make your little baby girl smile and nappy changing time. And if you have a stoma..use these so you don't grit teeth at the stinging/burning that most wipes cause and actually feel clean once you have used them.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 February 2024"
"8","WaterWipes Plastic-Free Original Baby Wipes, 720 Count (12 packs), 99.9% Water Based Wipes, Unscented for Sensitive Skin","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","BE Harrold","Water wipes have been a game changer for me, and I use them for all kinds of personal care and also for my dogs, one of which has severe allergies like me. So far I've only found two brands that do not trigger my pompholyx eczema too badly, Waterwipes and Cheeky Panda. Many other brands that claim to be ""99% water"" still have chemicals in, and in me that means the itching within seconds and itchy blisters start forming.Performance- they aren't as thick as some other brands, and it seems they used to be a little thicker as well, but they're still thick enough to be effective and hold onto water and be used firmly, and it also makes it easier to clean fiddly bits like ears so it isn't a big loss that they're a little thinner. As they don't have many added ingredients, it means you can still use them with any cleanser or lotion of your choice and irritants aren't sealed in close to the skin by lotion. As mentioned earlier, I also use them for my dog with allergies as we have to wipe his face with something that hasn't been washed in detergents to remove any traces that might trigger his contact allergy. The wipes are strong enough to not tear or disintegrate when used on his whiskers, but at the same time they're soft so they don't damage his thin, fragile, soft whippety skin.I get that for some they smell a bit unappealing due to the lack of perfumes, but for many people those are the worst triggers for their allergies, and some people may want lotion in their baby wipes so to them it will seem like they're missing those ingredients, but this is what allergy sufferers need, products that are as pure as possible. Of course some people may still be sensitive to any of the ingredients in these wipes, but for my allergy needs Waterwipes are perfect and leave no residue to cause any other problems.Because of Waterwipes not having lotion or surfactants in, they are safe to be used near eyes and sensitive areas so can be used to take makeup off in conjunction with a suitable makeup remover, as well as facial cleansing. I personally now wouldn't travel without any, especially in public toilets which may have questionable hygiene and during air travel, even if you don't have kids they're so multipurpose and handy they quickly become the sort of thing where you wonder how you ever lived without them.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 December 2023"

These wipes are perfect if you have to constantly change your babies. One is enough as it has plenty of water that it can clean every bit of wat you need and still have some not touched. Even babies that get rashes or skin irritation these are perfect they dont dry out even for a couple months the pack is easy to use can get a few lids that rip the pack but that's if your pulling them open to hard in a rush. Some wipes can get stuck together but alot less than many other brands. Huggies have nothing on this company as you can see there baby wipes leaving white bits all over when using them. These wipes nothing comes off them no bits of white on fabric or stuck to bums the best brand out there worth paying for as you will use less wipes than you do with any others so you will save money buy spending alittle more and also alot healthier on ur skin as many other brands would cause skin irritation or rashes.

Most wipes do still have plastic in them and if you dig those up in 50yrs time they will still be recognisable as baby wipes. Bad for the planet, bad for animals on land and sea(PLEASE DONT FLUSH WIPES DOWN THE LOO. THEY DON'T DISSOLVE. NO WIPES DO. causing blockages in sewer pipes ND harm at sea. Thank you.) These wipes don't leave your skin feeling sticky when you're skin is cleaned. So BIG bonus. Only problem I have is that the wipes don't come out of the packet easy. If the big brand most used(in UK anyway) can make each wipe follow on from the last when pulled out. Why can't you, or a lot of other makes for that matter. I have to fiddle around trying to find the end of the next wipe without either ripping the wipe or pulling a lot of them out at once coz i need them quickly and then trying to stuff the ones not used back in the packet or wiping surfaces with them just to use them but then I run out of wipes for the purpose I need them. Most annoying ND expensive. Which no-one needs right now.This is the only fault with them tho' it is a pain in emergency's. I will keep buying this brand coz they are not expensive, don't sting, don't leave sticky residue and don't contain plastic in the wipes(the packet obviously is plastic). I would recommend for these reasons. Make your little baby girl smile and nappy changing time. And if you have a stoma..use these so you don't grit teeth at the stinging/burning that most wipes cause and actually feel clean once you have used them.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 February 2024"

As a parent, one of my top priorities is ensuring the well-being of my little one, and that includes choosing products that are safe, gentle, and environmentally friendly. WaterWipes Original Plastic Free Baby Wipes have become an essential part of my daily baby care routine, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. Here's why these wipes deserve a five-star review:1.Pure and Gentle: WaterWipes are specifically designed with babies in mind. They contain only two ingredients – 99.9% purified water and a drop of fruit extract. This minimalistic approach ensures that my baby's sensitive skin is pampered without exposure to harsh chemicals, fragrances, or irritants.2.Ultimate Convenience: With a pack of 360 wipes in each bundle, these wipes are perfect for busy parents. I never have to worry about running out of wipes at inconvenient times. Plus, the wipes are conveniently sized, making them easy to use one-handed.3.Superior Quality: The wipes themselves are strong, durable, and have a smooth texture that effectively cleans without causing any abrasions. They are moist enough to get the job done but not overly wet, which I appreciate.4.Eco-Friendly Choice: One of the standout features of WaterWipes is their commitment to sustainability. These wipes are plastic-free, and the packaging is recyclable. It's reassuring to know that I'm not contributing to environmental pollution while caring for my baby.5.Versatile Use: These wipes are not just for diaper changes. I've found them handy for various tasks, from wiping messy hands and faces to cleaning up spills and even refreshing on-the-go. Their versatility makes them a practical choice for any parent.6.Hypoallergenic: WaterWipes are dermatologist-approved and hypoallergenic. This is a huge relief for parents of babies with sensitive skin or allergies, as it reduces the risk of irritation or rashes.7.No Nasty Residue: After using WaterWipes, I've noticed there's no sticky residue left behind on my baby's skin, which can sometimes happen with other wipes. Their pure and gentle nature ensures my baby stays clean and comfortable.In summary, WaterWipes Original Plastic Free Baby Wipes have exceeded my expectations in every way. They provide the utmost care for my baby's skin while also aligning with my values of environmental responsibility. With a generous count in each pack, they're a practical and cost-effective choice. I wholeheartedly recommend WaterWipes to fellow parents who want the best for their little ones without compromising on quality or sustainability. These wipes have become an indispensable part of my parenting journey, and I wouldn't have it any other way.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2023"
