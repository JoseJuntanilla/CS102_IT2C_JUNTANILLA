"1","Lewis-Plast Premium First Aid Kit For Home Car Holiday And Workplace - Includes Bandages, Eye Pods, Ice Packs And Essentials For Everyday Situations, 90 Count (Pack of 1)","4.8 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","This is actually the second one of these I have purchased over the past couple of years as I wanted one for upstairs  and downstairs due to having mobility issues and needing to use a starlit I felt that should anything happen and I was unable to get downstairs in time it made sense having already bought one previously I went for the same knowing I could trust it to have what I required. Ideal for homes and small businesses alike and a good price. Would recommend this for both and probs for caravaning or camping and even travelling abroad as it is small and compact but contains alot. Excellent and would buy again.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2024"

Well packed and lightweight. Comprehensive contents that I will add too i.e. tube of antiseptic cream, a better pair of scissors, painkillers etc. Was confused at first (as others are looking at the 1 star reviews) with the dates on some of the contents which appeared to show that they were out of date. Rang the parent company that supply Amazon, who are an established reputable medical supplier, and they explained that, those contents that are 'sterile', will have a date when the item was packed (alongside a picture of a building) AND an expiry date (alongside a picture of an egg timer). Picture attached. If the items are not sterile however, then they will NOT have an expiry date, just a date when they were packed. Have suggested that the company put a note to that effect in their packs which they will take on board moving forward.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 February 2024"
