"4","Victorinox Swiss Army Knife Sharpener, Dual Knife Sharpener Professional, Swiss Made, Portable, Black/Red","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","A. Epicure","The Good ... I got one in the end, sadly at the full Â£13 tag, as the offer price meant you had to prove your age for some reason, nope, not for this product so I had to wait.  It's super useful for a light touch up in the field. With the rounded edge you can get your mushroom knife or similar well edged, and the groove is useful for the back edge of the point or a fishing hook. It's a touch up sharpener not a honing one.  The dual end thing is ok but no needed.The Bad ...  the price is to high, they used to be well under Â£10 and offered at Â£10. The top that covers the little V shaped sharpener needs to fit better and with more of a detent so you can feel it's home, sadly it comes of if you're not careful. Attention to detail, something lacking in most things these days.If you're going to sell a product at an elevated price the quality should be reflected. In all the years I've been on amazon I seen maybe on or two 5star products and this is not one of them.  As for the rating features of a product, we don't need to, it just confuses people and increases the rating.It's good but not that good. Useful but not essential. I like it, I bought it.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 February 2024"

"8","Victorinox Swiss Army Knife Sharpener, Dual Knife Sharpener Professional, Swiss Made, Portable, Black/Red","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Big D","Absolutely brilliant. Very easy to use.Just ordered two more so I can keep one in the kitchen and one in my van.You can sharpen at work, in front of the telly, up a mountain, no messing with water or anything, you can use it anywhere without a bench.I've used it to great effect on Pen Knives, Pocket Knives, Kitchen Knives, Sushi Knives, Carving Knives, Hunting Knives, Cutlery Steel, Carbon Steel, Razor Steel, all no problem with excellent results.Few tips :It's not a Chef's Steel, don't try and use it like one.Here's the biggie NEVER USE IT WITH YOUR HAND IN FRONT OF THE BLADE. Sorry for shouting.Just flip the blade so the edge is away from you and hold the sharpener behind the blade.Pick your angle and sweep left and right like you're shading on a line with a pencil.Don't saw across the blade. Always run along the blade, left right, handle to tip. You don't need to do long full sweeps, just keep it even.Like this it's impossible to cut yourself or scratch the flat of the knife.As the edge apexes you'll start pushing a burr over the apex.Keep flipping sides and reducing pressure until the burr reduces to nothing.If you're not getting a good edge you are either not properly apexed yet or you're using too much pressure and knackering up the apex.The last sweeps should feel like warm butter with a feather pressure.Test the edge on a single sheet of paper, that'll show you where you need to do more work.Scrub deposits off the sharpener on cardboard or a roll of paper.If you want to polish or strop the edge afterwards use a leather belt for razor steel or leather with polishing compound on it for harder steels.Yes, you can do a faster better job with Â£300 worth of Japanese Whetstones, but come on, are you a Sushi Chef or do you just want your knives to work properly? ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚Anyway, this is much easier to use on smaller blades and doesn't make a mess.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2024"

Works really well as long as used properly (like most things really).  Easy to carry with good build quality.  If youâ€™ve never sharpened a blade before I recommend you check on YouTube so you start off correctly.  Easy to carry into the field to sharpen your Swiss Army or most other knives to be honest.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 May 2023"

Very easy to use.Just ordered two more so I can keep one in the kitchen and one in my van.You can sharpen at work, in front of the telly, up a mountain, no messing with water or anything, you can use it anywhere without a bench.I've used it to great effect on Pen Knives, Pocket Knives, Kitchen Knives, Sushi Knives, Carving Knives, Hunting Knives, Cutlery Steel, Carbon Steel, Razor Steel, all no problem with excellent results.Few tips :It's not a Chef's Steel, don't try and use it like one.Here's the biggie NEVER USE IT WITH YOUR HAND IN FRONT OF THE BLADE. Sorry for shouting.Just flip the blade so the edge is away from you and hold the sharpener behind the blade.Pick your angle and sweep left and right like you're shading on a line with a pencil.Don't saw across the blade. Always run along the blade, left right, handle to tip. You don't need to do long full sweeps, just keep it even.Like this it's impossible to cut yourself or scratch the flat of the knife.As the edge apexes you'll start pushing a burr over the apex.Keep flipping sides and reducing pressure until the burr reduces to nothing.If you're not getting a good edge you are either not properly apexed yet or you're using too much pressure and knackering up the apex.The last sweeps should feel like warm butter with a feather pressure.Test the edge on a single sheet of paper, that'll show you where you need to do more work.Scrub deposits off the sharpener on cardboard or a roll of paper.If you want to polish or strop the edge afterwards use a leather belt for razor steel or leather with polishing compound on it for harder steels.Yes, you can do a faster better job with Â£300 worth of Japanese Whetstones, but come on, are you a Sushi Chef or do you just want your knives to work properly? ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚Anyway, this is much easier to use on smaller blades and doesn't make a mess.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2024"
