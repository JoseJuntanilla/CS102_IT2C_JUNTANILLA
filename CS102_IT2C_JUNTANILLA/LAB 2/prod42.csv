The concept is great. The game needs ro come with blindfolds. The reality is regardless its slightly too easy to figure out who is the bad wombat. Buy thus exclusively to terrorise your children for twenty minutes before playing the Burrito or avocado game instead","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2024"

We had a hilarious half and hour or so playing this the other night, unfortunately the friends I was playing it with didn't want to be in a video so I could not get any actual game play in this review video i'm afraid . I have done a quick video to show you what's in the box, and for me the comic booklet that comes with it is a very close second to the actual game and great in its own right!The idea of the game is to cover your eyes with one hand whilst trying to build blocks in sequential order with the other... well most of you are... there is an evil wombat who is trying to destroy all your towers! It is very easily as hard as it sounds... and then some! After you get to grips with the basic game there is other power card that can be incorporated into the game too. Ive done a quick video showing you what's actually in the box and I will try and get a quick vid of some game play the next time I find some players who are less camera shy... But all I can say is its great fun and I can see it being an essential family game as well as a brilliant ice breaker to take to university. Really well priced at £25, all hail the wicked wombat!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2023"

We played this as a family of all ages at christmas. It was really easy to set up and understand. At first from the description is seemed like it would be over really quickly and not much fun but actually it was the best game we played.

We were really looking forward to venturing into wombats for the first time but the game was used nly once and then has never been picked to play on family nights again.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2022"
"8","Exploding Kittens Hand to Hand Wombat Card Game Fun Family Card Games for Adults Teens & Kids - Fun Party Games, 3-6 players","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"S","This is a really quick and simple party game to play. It suggests being for 3-6 players. 2 people can't play the game together however more than 6 could play. It might just get a little chaotic.At the start of the game you're all assigned the role of either a good wombat or a bad wombat. If you're a good wombat, you try to build the towers and get points at the end of the round if you've completed two or more. The bad wombats score points by ensuring that only one tower or less have been completed by the end of the round. You're team wins when you reach 3 points.How don't you know who is who? The building and knocking down is done with your eyes closed or blindfolded!There's also a definite among us vibe involved in trying to find out who the imposter like Bad Wombats are.So a fun dexterity party game for multiple people with no real age limit required as anyone can understand the principal of being good or bad and can be shown the cards so even if they can't read, they know which role they are.It's not cheap for a board game, but equally its not expensive either and is pretty averagely priced.The components are plastic but seem sturdy enough to be up to the job and not likely to break.Happy to recommend.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2023"
"9","Exploding Kittens Hand to Hand Wombat Card Game Fun Family Card Games for Adults Teens & Kids - Fun Party Games, 3-6 players","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"Angel","Really surprised so many people found this fun - for our kids (aged 8 and 12) it just turns into carnage and just doesn’t really feel like anyone is getting anywhere. Feels like the game is skewed really heavily towards the baddies.  I like the concept and the pieces are well made but, for us, it wasn’t very enjoyable at all. Tried to encourage kids to persevere but they were bored really quickly.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2024"

We were really looking forward to venturing into wombats for the first time but the game was used nly once and then has never been picked to play on family nights again.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2022"
"48","Exploding Kittens Hand to Hand Wombat Card Game Fun Family Card Games for Adults Teens & Kids - Fun Party Games, 3-6 players","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA,"S","This is a really quick and simple party game to play. It suggests being for 3-6 players. 2 people can't play the game together however more than 6 could play. It might just get a little chaotic.At the start of the game you're all assigned the role of either a good wombat or a bad wombat. If you're a good wombat, you try to build the towers and get points at the end of the round if you've completed two or more. The bad wombats score points by ensuring that only one tower or less have been completed by the end of the round. You're team wins when you reach 3 points.How don't you know who is who? The building and knocking down is done with your eyes closed or blindfolded!There's also a definite among us vibe involved in trying to find out who the imposter like Bad Wombats are.So a fun dexterity party game for multiple people with no real age limit required as anyone can understand the principal of being good or bad and can be shown the cards so even if they can't read, they know which role they are.It's not cheap for a board game, but equally its not expensive either and is pretty averagely priced.The components are plastic but seem sturdy enough to be up to the job and not likely to break.Happy to recommend.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2023"

Feels like the game is skewed really heavily towards the baddies.  I like the concept and the pieces are well made but, for us, it wasn’t very enjoyable at all. Tried to encourage kids to persevere but they were bored really quickly.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2024"

Quickly became boring as it was obvious only the bad guys could win and it never really got anywhere.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 September 2022"
