"1","aZengear Paracord Survival Bracelet (2 Pack) | Flint Steel Fire Starter, Compass, Whistle,Hiking Accessories, Wild Camping Equipment Kit, Bushcraft, Emergency (Black and Orange)","4.2 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Gary Kelly","Good multifuction product. The only dislike is that the draw string spring is a little loose. Other than that it works perfect. The flint was good, the strike was nice and sharp so you could easily scrap some wood the strike the flint for a fire. I mean it was €12 for two of them so if you are living in the wild you probably would buy something better but I hike regularly and have taken it on 5 hikes now and have used it to navigate each hike when my phone signal was down. Overall it is a good product and comfortable to wear.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"
"2","aZengear Paracord Survival Bracelet (2 Pack) | Flint Steel Fire Starter, Compass, Whistle,Hiking Accessories, Wild Camping Equipment Kit, Bushcraft, Emergency (Black and Orange)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Steve","Since I bought this item, I've only ever taken this off to do the dishes or get a wash. It's a brilliant yet simple piece of survival kit you never know you'll need. ""Better to have something you don't need than to need it and not have it."" Are the words I live by.Every piece of this gear works as intended, the compass (when unclipped) actually works and points in the correct direction, my kids love grabbing my arm and blowing the whistle, so that's getting some use and driving the missy insane. I'm glad to know I can always start a fire if a survival situation should ever arrive with the flint scraper and rod. I find it very comfortable to wear and most often forget it's even there. Worth every penny, and best to be safe!The only issue I have, is the wrist toggle, while I appreciate that you can increase or decrease the size of the wrist length, the toggle is a bit weak and keeps losing up, but thats an easy fix for me.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"
"3","aZengear Paracord Survival Bracelet (2 Pack) | Flint Steel Fire Starter, Compass, Whistle,Hiking Accessories, Wild Camping Equipment Kit, Bushcraft, Emergency (Black and Orange)","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Gary Kelly","The band is quite sturdy and adjustable , can't figure out how you would undo the paracord though , the ferrous and steel did manage to ignite some flaked up toilet paper , so that's a plus . The steel saw says removable but I cannot remove it as it appears glued in , which brings me to the compass , the compass will only give a true reading when the wrist band is separated as the saw/steel for the ignitor is too close to the compass and effects it like a magnet . Once you separate the 2 ends clipped together and put some distance between the metal and the compass it works just fine . The whistle is very basic as expected . Given that an all black band and a black and orange band are included , basically getting 2 for the price of one , I can't complain. It all does what it should do really , although positioning of the ignitor steel would have been better placed away from the compass.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"

The fire starter does produce a spark although it isn't as large or easy as the one shown in the video although maybe I just need more practice.I've seen a few comments referencing that the compass doesn't appear to work, which it does but there is a slight issue.The metal blade built into the clip which attaches to the compass section interferes with it and causes the north to constantly point towards the metal which makes the compass appear to be broken when in fact it is just being overridden by the metal of the blade.This means that when the clip is undone it is a perfectly operational piece of equipment that is able to quickly reposition itself as you move but as soon as you wear it the metal overrides it and the north becomes frozen.Excluding the compass issue this appears the be an outstanding piece of equipment which is very lightweight and portable, some parts are a little wonky but at this price for two items you can't complain.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2024"
