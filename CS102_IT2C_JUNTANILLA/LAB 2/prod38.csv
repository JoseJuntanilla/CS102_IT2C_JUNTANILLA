"1","Petzl Core Rechargeable Battery","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","No-one","So much better than having batterys that last a few days then end up being thrown, lasts a few weeks then recharge and reuse, great job PETZL.

"2","Petzl Core Rechargeable Battery","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Andrew Green","I don't know how I've managed without this for so long. I've been using AAA's until they run out and then replacing them. This avoids all that faff with a great batter life and quick charging.I use mine for trail running at night and it will usually give me at least four hours of good light.I would give it 5 stars but it's not cheap.
