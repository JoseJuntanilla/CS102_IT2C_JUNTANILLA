"1","Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover | Removes New and Dried-in Stains | Includes Applicator Brush, 650 ml","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","primeuser101","I’ve tried many different products to remove stains, but none of them worked as well as this one. Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover is amazing. It removes new and dried-in stains, even the ones that have been there for months. It works on all kinds of stains, such as coffee, wine, mud, chocolate, and more. It also eliminates odors and leaves a fresh scent.The product comes with a 650 ml bottle and an applicator brush. The bottle has a nozzle that allows you to spray the product directly on the stain. The applicator brush has stiff bristles that help to scrub the stain and lift it off the carpet fibers. The product is easy to use and doesn’t require any rinsing or vacuuming. You just spray, brush, and blot with a clean cloth. The stain disappears in minutes.The only thing I don’t like about this product is that it’s quite expensive. However, I think it’s worth it, because it saves me time and money in the long run. I don’t have to hire a professional carpet cleaner or replace my carpets. I can keep them looking new and clean with this product.Overall, this is a fantastic product for anyone who has carpets and pets or kids. It removes stains quickly and effectively, and it’s easy to use. It’s a miracle worker for stubborn carpet stains. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a reliable carpet cleaner.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 December 2023"

Absolute nightmare. Enter Dr Beckman's carpet cleaner. Did a magnificent job considering I avoided the mess for a food few days before scrubbing this into the carpet.It works, it lifted the stain brilliantly, the best way I've found it to rub this in (as per the bottle) and then really heavily dab a cloth (or baby wipes in my case) and the foam lifts the stain out into the cloth.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024"
"50","Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover | Removes New and Dried-in Stains | Includes Applicator Brush, 650 ml","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","heather","We had a puppy for a week over Christmas, my daughter sensibly kept the puppy away from the kids until after the festivities, they got a cute gift after New Year. Imagine an eight week old puppy running wild in your living room because the cats hate him and you are responsible for handing him back with two eyes intact and functioning?Now imagine your carpet if you aren’t quick enough to carry him to the garden? This stuff is amazing, has saved a fortune in cleaning bills and it totally works. Highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2024"
