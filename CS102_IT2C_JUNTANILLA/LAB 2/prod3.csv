I had to Google how to install the new protection, but you basically have to go in My Account on the App, and manually select it.It’s easy to install, but only when you know how to!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 October 2023"

"3","McAfee Total Protection 2024, 1 Device | Antivirus, VPN, Password Manager, Mobile and Internet Security | PC/Mac/iOS/Android|1 Year Subscription | Activation Code by email","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","DE","I have been using this product for a few years and I always buy from Amazon due to price (the auto-renewal from McAfee is much more - although I do note they have a special offer on this year at 2 years for £27 ish per year which is pretty good).It installs easy on PC (windows) and on my android phone, but iPad is a real pain.  What is not explained, (and I am thankful to another reviewer for the hint) is that, is that it will not work on an iPad unless you use the Chrome browser. Most things default to safari so you need to be clear about how you do it!The other thing which is also not mentioned in any instructions is the app on iPad is not ""Total Protection"" - it offers ""Mcafee Security: VPN & Privacy"".  But after you (finally ......!) complete the install and 'sync account', you will see it counts as one of your 10 licenses against ""Total Protection"".The other thing I noted is that the VPN product, while worth having if you spend lots of time in coffee shops on strange wifi, is limited to 500mb while using the VPN so it's really a trial - and that is not advertised, Amazon need to grip that.  500mb is not going to last very long at all.The protection it gives is really good, but I feel the issues I mention above need addressing by both McAfee and Amazon and thus why it lost a star","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 October 2023"

But it is also very very annoying, pop ups, try this, upgrade to that, all the time, they aren't in Windows notifications so I can't find a way to mute them or disable them.  Then on top of that for 3 months before it's due to expire you get hounded to turn on auto renew, problem is it is always cheaper to buy off amazon then it is to but from McAfee.

The product works well and if you buy it from somewhere like Amazon it comes at a great price. Like the other antivirus packages it sets automatic renewal as part of the installation process. You need to change this otherwise the renewal price will go up a massive amount ( I was quoted about£150.00). If you each year do not auto renew but buy from a retailer such as Amazon you can continue to get very good protection at a great price. Recommended as an antivirus program.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 October 2023"

As such I trusted their anti-virus protection and have kept it ever since. It's something I often regret as it's horribly flawed.  Not least their bullying attempt to get you to turn on auto-renew. [Never do that!]  They will rip you off.  Instead I learnt to buy my yearly subscription from Amazon for a fraction of the price [Good work Amazon!]. It requires jumping through many hoops, but the savings make it worthwhile as it's only once a year.  That said, whilst the protection they offer feels reassuring it's negated by the total harassment of the pop up notifications that can't be turned off, no matter what.  Most annoying - for me - is the pop up that constantly appears 3 months [3 MONTHS!] before your subscription lapses. It attempts to scare you into submission and force you down the more expensive path. It strikes me as a dreadful business model; but having worked for them doesn't surprise.  The senior management in my time were complete clenching sphincters, full of male toxicity. It appears nothing has changed on that front.  The only reason I continue with this poor service is the free VPN, which is occasionally useful.  Choose McAfee - if like me - you are prepared to fight crappy systems.  They still remain better than Norton in every sector [those guys are just rubbish].  I hope on many levels someone that counts reads this review as it's my true and honest testimony.  I'd also add that Windows Defender is very good and you probably don't need extra protection, but I'm a 'Belt and Braces' kinda guy.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2024"

This year however is the first time I had problems with installing it. I had to uninstall the old version of the software before the new version would install. That has never been an issue before - it just used to find the old software during the device check and then ask you if you wanted to uninstall the old version and install the new version. This time round it just gave a message ""unable to install the software because McAfee is already installed"". You need to uninstall the old version yourself before running the installation again.

Of course nobody wants so simple that adjustments can't be made but things like just trying to find the function you're looking for is not that clear.Part of the package, the VPN had a mind of its own and didn't always want to connect...even though my internet connect was fast and reliable!  I so wanted to utilise the VPN but it just kept dropping out for no reason (that I knew of) that I just had to turn it off - not helpful!To be honest, I installed the security system and have put my faith in its reliability - with scans, no threats have ever been found and whilst I'm on the net it stops installers, pop-ups etc etc, and warns me of dangerous websites.Would I buy this again? I always try to find value for money but over the ages having tried Bulldog, Norton, Kaspersky and now using McAfee - yes I would buy this again...if it was the best value for money.  One thing I don't like about any of the big named security providers is that they want to have ""auto renewal"" turned on when you first install the system; McAfee however, does not force you into this - you have the option if you want to turn this or or not.Overall score would've been better if the UI was improved.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2024"

This was a fraction of the price. I followed instructions exactly and nothing worked. If you have a problem they give you a link but this is a FAQ page- absolutely no help and a you tube link - ditto). I passed it over to someone who understands IT but he gave up after 45 mins. I kept following the install instructions and well over an hour later I had deleted the original and installed the new one. I had done nothing different. However, whilst it is working now it has started to give me a ‘due to be deleted’ warning so I’m still not sure about it. Also both old and new are classed as Total Protection but some of these items are missing and are listed as updates.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2023"

They justify it by saying it stops the product expiring and your devices not being protected, fair enough but it also has the effect that if you forget to check the renewal price and let it auto renew, it could be much higher than your first year price. Instead of getting a prompt to renew and then reminding you to shop around for a deal.I left Norton this year as on their annual license listed on amazon it said they needed your card details and you would have to set up a subscription, so moved to mcafee as no mention of this in the description at the time, only to find out subscription required the same as Norton, so I felt a bit misled by that.After unsubscribing from auto renewal, the antivirus/security downloads and functions in the background as you would expect. Very easy setup and easy to use, no problems with usability and performance . License for mobile devices includes handy lost device locator.Perfectly functional, easy to use and a great product, just be ready with credit card and watch the auto renewal.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2024"

As your subscription comes to an end you tend to get a lot of reminders and ‘discount offers’ from McAfee encouraging renewal before your current subscription comes to an end. The prices they offer are pretty high IMHO. I always buy another copy from Amazon which is so much cheaper and the best way to do this. Absolutely no problems updating the subscription and as long as these deals continue I will re-purchase every year. The product itself does exactly what it is meant to, although the VPN functionality is very limited compared to a specialist VPN provider. Saying this, my main reason for purchase is the anti-virus, malware and online protection which is top rate.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 May 2023"

Having been stung by McAfee's expensive automatic renewal process in the past I had turned off the auto renew function so I could do it manually.If I had renewed directly through McAfee, they wanted US$169 as their default was to upgrade to something I didn't need. I could have switched to a lower package for US$69 or bought the full Total Protection package download direct from McAfee for £69.I opted instead to get the very same Total Protection 2019 download from Amazon for just under £21 which covers up to 10 devices (other options are available for 1, 3 or 5 devices). This is the exact same product that I was already using which simplifies the process. (It automatically updates to the latest version so I started 2 years ago with the 2017 version which has updated a few times). It's a digital download and Amazon sent an activation code by e-mail within 2 minutes.I was half expecting to have to remove and re-download the software on all my devices as payback for being too tight to pay the auto renewal fee but thankfully that was not the case. I just followed the instructions to activate the code using my existing McAfee account and it immediately updated the subscription across all registered devices. Really quick and simple.They tell you it can take a day or two for the new expiry date to appear on all devices but you can refresh it manually, which I did, and it all worked perfectly.One thing to remember though is when you renew the subscription, it re-sets the renewal option to automatic for next time and McAfee process the auto renewal a month or two early just to catch you out. If you want to avoid that happening you need to go into settings to switch off the auto renewal function every time you renew. There's no way you can forget about it because you get reminders popping up every day from about 2 months before renewal date.Yes McAfee have some questionable business practices but the product works and keeps my devices secure.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2024"

So I decided to look around......on the official McAffee website they wanted £60!........PC world were way cheaper (coming in at same price as Amazon) but they dont offer code key via email anymore!? So with postage and you have to wait (I don't drive and don't live near a store to collect easily) I continued my search............So I found myself back at Amazon........couldn't believe the price difference and code key via email available!.......So after reading reviews decided to go for it.Found it very easy to install......Email comes through with code and link.Download and install.....I already had a version on there so it auto detects and uninstalls, then reinstalled new version. (Needed to restart system to continue install)Entered code key somewhere along the steps (can't remember when)And doneREMEMBER to go into options and unclick AUTO RENEW......its way cheaper just buying like new, you will save loads.Added all my devices easily, click add device from app, send email with link to that device, and then, using the device, follow instructions to install.Couldn't be happier with product and service, never had a issue......and for the price.......well.......I was not going to pay x3 more for the same thing.Recommend(From past experiences with installments, if you are having trouble installing, make sure any previous versions have been removed.

Complete installation from scratch last year was trouble-free and I've been impressed by the software over the last 12 months, so that, and the Amazon price this time, made renewal a no-brainer. The renewal process was remarkably straightforward. The Amazon email arrived immediately with the renewal code, and I followed the email instructions to go to the McAfee activate page. When I put in the renewal code and my email address, McAfee detected that I already had an account / licences with them, asked me to sign in (which I did) and then asked my to confirm that I wanted to apply the renewal to the 2019 Total Protection (rather than an older McAfee product on a now defunct computer). When I confirmed this, McAfee extended the TP licence expiry to the 2021 anniversary of the 2019 version, so I'll have the 2020 version for about 10 days more than the straight 365. And because I was just renewing TP, there was no need to remove old licences / versions and install TP from scratch. The whole process from signing into Amazon to buy through to signing out of McAfee and starting my first 2020 AV scan (just as a precaution) took less than 10 minutes. I'm very impressed. The AV software runs fine, the Amazon price is amazing, and I'm very happy to recommend both companies.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2019"

However, when renewal time comes round, the price is ridiculous. Went to Amazon, ordered this product and paid about 1/3 of the renewal price from McAfee. Received an email within a minute with a new 25-digit code. Open McAfee, enter the code and hit send, and immediately an extra 365 days is added to my account on all 10 devices. Why would you want to pay more? Excellent service","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 June 2023"
