However, what really annoys me is the cost for auto renewal. In round numbers (I hate messing around with all these 99p) renewal was going to cost me £90.  When  I hadn’t renewed within a couple of weeks of the expiry date Norton sent a special offer of just £30. However, I then realised I could buy the product again at just £13. It did take slightly longer to install but the saving was worth the time.I immediately turned off auto renew on the newly purchased product. Two months later I received an email saying that if I switched on auto renew I would get an extra 3 months of cover.

The probelm that everyone complains about. That you need to input your card details or you cannot activate the product. There are no words of that kind of behaviour.2. About the system to claim on the Norton guarantee of a refund if they cannot remove a virus. You have to be subscribed to automatic renewal. If you put your card details in to activate Norton, which initiates automatic renewal, then cancel automatic renewal. You can't use the guarantee.3. The app is flaky. When you move your mouse over any of the Norton windows that are open, your mouse lags. It makes using the app, unpleasant.4. If you have your PC on for a few hours the VPN on/off button stops working, forcing you to reboot to gain control.5. I was pleased about the back up data allowance. I figured I might want to back up the odd picture/document. Only to be extremely disappointed. When I went to look at this feature, it required being set-up. At the start of this process, it asked if I wanted to back up all my pictures on my PC. Declining means not being able to use the back-up system.6. Installing add on security features like Norton Safe Search is not user friendly. If you add 'safe-search' it affects something I use often. E.g. you are on a webpage and see a line of text you want to google. You can left-click and drag across it, then right click on it. Then there is an option to search google for that highlighted text. With Safe-Search enabled, Norton takes that over and displays Norton results and not Google results. I.e. changing your search engine. I have had to revert back to copying text I want to search on, and paste it into google.This is a far as I got. I gave up installing add-ons of any kind, because I could not be bothered with the hassle. Very likely I would not have liked how other features operate. There are a few features I am not even trying to use. To a certain extent I gave up exploring other general options too.The VPN is handy if you want to view region restricted content. However using a VPN on a regular basis is somewhat a pain. Wesites load noticabely slower. Some websites are blocked to VPNs, because VPN anonimity is what hackers use. Amazon Priome Video is 50/50 whether it will let you stream with the VPN on. If yu use the VPN day-today, you may have to turn it off to use Amazon Prime Video. ... Whereas other brand/manufacturer VPNs are fine.There are far too many pop-ups in the lower right side of your monitor. I don't mean good advice like 'this file is safe etc'. I mean stuff about do you want to buy a product to stop tracking cookies? Adverts and more than one type. Sometimes you'll get three over short period of time, and be swearing at having to close irritating ad pop-ups. Like what the hell is Norton doing contacting me on my PC desktop experience?","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024"

HOWEVER, Norton as a company continues to engage in some of the most egregious business practices to catch out those who are less tech savvy, so they are potentially, and unwittingly, hit with the full £90 (at time of writing) annual renewal fee or cajoled into paying for additional add-ons.The pros:In my time using Norton my pc has never, as far as I’m aware, caught a virus.It is easy to open and run a scan.The cons:Where to begin (!). As many reviews state you should always deactivate the auto renewal and buy a new license key at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately Norton make activating a new key this way as labyrinthine as possible. The online help will tell you to go to a settings page in your current installation of Norton and put in the new key. However, if you have disabled auto renew this method will show an error code that will force you to log in to the main website. Here, to activate your new key Norton will insist that you enter your credit card details and enable auto renew before you then can (& have) to download a new install of the app (that you already have installed on your pc) before it will activate. This also means you will lose any remaining time on your current Norton install as it doesn’t link the subscriptions.The autorenewal - Since I last installed this Norton appear to have changed the fine print so that if you have deactivated the annual auto-renewal  you also lose access to a number of features including the much vaunted “Virus Protection Promise” I.e. if your pc does get a virus…you have no recourse to Norton unless you’ve pre-agreed to let them charge you £90 next year, in advance. This makes no sense if you think about it. If you’re thinking all you’ll do is set a reminder to cancel the auto-renewal a couple of weeks or a month before the renewal date, Norton have also changed the fine print to state that they will take the next payment 35 days in advance (note that time period, as it’s before you start getting pop-up reminders ).The pop-ups/add-ons - once installed you will be hit with constant pop ups trying to upsell additional features and add-ins. Or pseudo-“critical’ notifications in red : “YOU HAVE X BROKEN REGISTRY ENTRIES- FIX NOW?” That, if clicked will take you to a page asking you to confirm the purchase of said add-on…. And they already have your credit card details from the setup process so, again, I can see how those less technically inclined can have unwitting added £20+ on to their annual subscription without even realising. You can turn these pop ups off but in reality they just seem to ‘snooze’ eventually coming back after a few days.In summary, yes, the core product seems to work well enough but the fact I have to put so much active effort in to avoiding being ripped off, or inadvertently charged additional costs makes me question Norton’s ethics and integrity as a company. Ultimately this will be the last time I  use them as there are alternatives out there, and it’s at the point now where it’s easier to go with a different product each year than trying to navigate Nortons renewal process.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023"

HOWEVER, Norton as a company continues to engage in some of the most egregious business practices to catch out those who are less tech savvy, so they are potentially, and unwittingly, hit with the full £90 (at time of writing) annual renewal fee or cajoled into paying for additional add-ons.The pros:In my time using Norton my pc has never, as far as I’m aware, caught a virus.It is easy to open and run a scan.The cons:Where to begin (!). As many reviews state you should always deactivate the auto renewal and buy a new license key at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately Norton make activating a new key this way as labyrinthine as possible. The online help will tell you to go to a settings page in your current installation of Norton and put in the new key. However, if you have disabled auto renew this method will show an error code that will force you to log in to the main website. Here, to activate your new key Norton will insist that you enter your credit card details and enable auto renew before you then can (& have) to download a new install of the app (that you already have installed on your pc) before it will activate. This also means you will lose any remaining time on your current Norton install as it doesn’t link the subscriptions.The autorenewal - Since I last installed this Norton appear to have changed the fine print so that if you have deactivated the annual auto-renewal  you also lose access to a number of features including the much vaunted “Virus Protection Promise” I.e. if your pc does get a virus…you have no recourse to Norton unless you’ve pre-agreed to let them charge you £90 next year, in advance. This makes no sense if you think about it. If you’re thinking all you’ll do is set a reminder to cancel the auto-renewal a couple of weeks or a month before the renewal date, Norton have also changed the fine print to state that they will take the next payment 35 days in advance (note that time period, as it’s before you start getting pop-up reminders ).The pop-ups/add-ons - once installed you will be hit with constant pop ups trying to upsell additional features and add-ins. Or pseudo-“critical’ notifications in red : “YOU HAVE X BROKEN REGISTRY ENTRIES- FIX NOW?” That, if clicked will take you to a page asking you to confirm the purchase of said add-on…. And they already have your credit card details from the setup process so, again, I can see how those less technically inclined can have unwitting added £20+ on to their annual subscription without even realising. You can turn these pop ups off but in reality they just seem to ‘snooze’ eventually coming back after a few days.In summary, yes, the core product seems to work well enough but the fact I have to put so much active effort in to avoiding being ripped off, or inadvertently charged additional costs makes me question Norton’s ethics and integrity as a company. Ultimately this will be the last time I  use them as there are alternatives out there, and it’s at the point now where it’s easier to go with a different product each year than trying to navigate Nortons renewal process.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023"

Ultimately this will be the last time I  use them as there are alternatives out there, and it’s at the point now where it’s easier to go with a different product each year than trying to navigate Nortons renewal process.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023"
"50","Norton 360 Deluxe 2024, Antivirus Software for 3 Devices and 1-Year Subscription with Automatic ‎Renewal, Includes Secure VPN and Password Manager, PC/Mac/iOS/Android, Activation Code by email","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Mr","Have used it for many years and has served me well. It is far cheaper on Amazon than renewing direct with Norton weho ask four to five times the price. I have to give my card details in order to get the Utility programme which is necessaryl, and then have to cancel renewal every year, but it is worth it to avoid Norton's high prices.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2022"
