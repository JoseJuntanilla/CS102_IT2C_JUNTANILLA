These bags are large so there's plenty of much needed room inside and although I used to prefer bags with handles, these bags are just as easy to tie up and I actually prefer this type of bag now. I keep a roll with a small rubber band around them in mine. It saves space, my pockets are tidier and it's much easier to find a tissue in my coat pocket than it was with loose bags in them! If I'm out without a coat, I keep a half-roll in my 5th jeans pocket. They fit in there rather nicely!As well as being big (22 x 33 cm), these bags are strong! They don't tear easily and I've never poked a finger through these bags, very much unlike the more 'nappy bag' bags I used to use before! They are a big step up from those flimsy bags and although the cost is a little more I find I'm using less bags and I don't need to double bag them to stop or reduce smells escaping from bags in my garden dog bin either, even in the summer. They are definitely a more hygienic option. The dog bin used to smell bad in warm weather but these bags really do a good job of keeping the smell (therefore the bacteria) in the bag. I do sometimes get a whiff from the bags during hot sunny summer weather though.Does anyone wake up some mornings to find foxes have broken into your bin and strewn bags all over the garden? I do! I have a fox problem here, perhaps likely from a couple of my neighbours who keep chickens and ducks, but ""problem"" depends on your view on foxes, of course! For me, mine are garden pests but I like them otherwise. Point here is these bags have never split from being thrown around by foxes, although I'm sure they could get into them if they really wanted to. I'm still devising solutions to stop them getting into my bin!The rolls have 15 bags on each. The perforations are good and in line and this ensures they are easy to remove from the roll. I've not had even one bag wasted by tearing it when tearing one off the roll. I buy the 270 pack so they work out at around 4p each when buying the pack at full price (currently £10.99). For me, that's a cost of 84p per week.Note! They are certified 65% recycled plastic now and I'm keen to reduce my plastic waste so this is a big plus for me. I hope this company continues to be environmentally conscious because when companies provide more environmental products it helps consumers make better choices.Pros65% recycled plasticLarge and strongDo not tear easilyLeakproofEasy to tie upEasy to rip a bag off the rollSmells leak less in hot weather otherwise no noticeable smell at all.ConsMore expensive than other bags.

They are very large and being on a roll save so much time just pulling one as needed instead of scrabbling to extricate one from a pocket full of thin loose black bags.

They are very large and being on a roll save so much time just pulling one as needed instead of scrabbling to extricate one from a pocket full of thin loose black bags. There is no unpleasant smell to them; they are strong, leak proof and, by not closing them completely, will easily accommodate further ‘deposits’ even from a very large dog.

These bags are large so there's plenty of much needed room inside and although I used to prefer bags with handles, these bags are just as easy to tie up and I actually prefer this type of bag now. I keep a roll with a small rubber band around them in mine. It saves space, my pockets are tidier and it's much easier to find a tissue in my coat pocket than it was with loose bags in them! If I'm out without a coat, I keep a half-roll in my 5th jeans pocket. They fit in there rather nicely!As well as being big (22 x 33 cm), these bags are strong! They don't tear easily and I've never poked a finger through these bags, very much unlike the more 'nappy bag' bags I used to use before! They are a big step up from those flimsy bags and although the cost is a little more I find I'm using less bags and I don't need to double bag them to stop or reduce smells escaping from bags in my garden dog bin either, even in the summer. They are definitely a more hygienic option. The dog bin used to smell bad in warm weather but these bags really do a good job of keeping the smell (therefore the bacteria) in the bag. I do sometimes get a whiff from the bags during hot sunny summer weather though.Does anyone wake up some mornings to find foxes have broken into your bin and strewn bags all over the garden? I do! I have a fox problem here, perhaps likely from a couple of my neighbours who keep chickens and ducks, but ""problem"" depends on your view on foxes, of course! For me, mine are garden pests but I like them otherwise. Point here is these bags have never split from being thrown around by foxes, although I'm sure they could get into them if they really wanted to. I'm still devising solutions to stop them getting into my bin!The rolls have 15 bags on each. The perforations are good and in line and this ensures they are easy to remove from the roll. I've not had even one bag wasted by tearing it when tearing one off the roll. I buy the 270 pack so they work out at around 4p each when buying the pack at full price (currently £10.99). For me, that's a cost of 84p per week.Note! They are certified 65% recycled plastic now and I'm keen to reduce my plastic waste so this is a big plus for me. I hope this company continues to be environmentally conscious because when companies provide more environmental products it helps consumers make better choices.Pros65% recycled plasticLarge and strongDo not tear easilyLeakproofEasy to tie upEasy to rip a bag off the rollSmells leak less in hot weather otherwise no noticeable smell at all.ConsMore expensive than other bags. Potentially, it's a bag we throw away, so how good do you need your poo bags to be?Costs - for my dog's use4p per bag at full price = costs me around 84p per week1 roll (of 15 bags) lasts approx 5 daysThe whole pack of 270 bags lasts 54 days or approx 2 months.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 May 2023"

Catlow","I’ve had dogs all through my life and that’s a long while. I’ve used many a brand of Poo bag but the Earth Rated with a slight Lavender aroma are by far the best.They are of a good strong, thick quality. Plenty long enough to be able to tie in a knot and they don’t let any smell out.I’ve carried mine around a park before (full) and not noticed any pong.I love that you get a little sticker when you have 2 bags left on the roll, nothing worse than running out!They are fantastic value for money, I purchase mine on subscription so never run out. I wouldn’t buy anything else now.Definitely the best on the market.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2024"

These bags serve their purpose perfectly, making it easy and hygienic to clean up after my furry friend.One of the things I really like about these bags is their durability. They are thick and sturdy, so I never have to worry about any unpleasant surprises or leaks. They hold up well even with larger messes, providing a reliable solution for dog waste disposal.Another great feature is the size of the bags. They are large enough to accommodate waste from even the biggest dogs, ensuring I never run out of space. Plus, the easy-to-tear perforations make it convenient to grab a bag and go, saving time during those urgent moments.However, one aspect I wish could be improved is the scent control. While the bags do a decent job of containing the odor, there are times when it's still noticeable. It would be great if the bags had stronger scent-blocking capabilities to ensure complete freshness.All in all, Earth Rated Dog Poo Bags have been a trustworthy and practical choice for me as a dog owner in the UK.
