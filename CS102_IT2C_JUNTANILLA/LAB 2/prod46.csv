"1","UNO All Wild Card Game with 112 Cards, Gift for Kid, Family & Adult Game Night for Players 7 Years & Older, HHL33","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Matunda","Hey you wild card enthusiasts! I stumbled upon the UNO All Wild Card Game, and let me tell you, my life took a turn more unexpected than a surprise party at an introvert's house!So, there I am, unboxing this deck of unlimited chaos. It's like opening Pandora's box, but instead of unleashing doom, I get 112 cards of pure unpredictability. I thought, ""Great, a family game night staple!"" Little did I know, it's more like a wild night in Vegas.The key feature? Every card is a wild card. I felt like a wizard holding a deck of magical mischief. No matching colors or numbers â€“ it's like UNO took a walk on the wild side, and I'm the tour guide through chaos.Now, picture this: Date night. I thought, ""Let's spice things up with UNO All Wild."" Turns out, the game is more unpredictable than my dating history. The 'Wild Forced Swap' card? Let's just say it's not a recommended icebreaker.Family game night with parents was another adventure. The 'Wild Targeted Draw 2' card became a tool for settling old scores. Mom targeted Dad, Dad retaliated. Suddenly, I'm a referee in a domestic UNO dispute.Took it to work, thinking it's a team-building exercise. Boss loved the 'Wild Skip 2' card so much he skipped me right out of the company. Fired for playing UNO, but hey, worth it.Experimented with a child â€“ easy, right? Wrong. Kids are tactical geniuses. The moment they learned about the 'Wild Draw 4,' they used it strategically. Now, I owe a 7-year-old five ice creams.And pets? Tried playing with a goldfish. Turns out, they're not great at holding cards. My living room turned into a fishy UNO battlefield. Let's just say, Operation Fish-Draw didn't go swimmingly.Bad feature alert: The 'Wild Swap Hands.' Used it with my cousin, and now I know more about his life choices than I ever wanted. Turns out, some secrets should stay in the deck.Quality of life upgrade? Absolutely. My social calendar is busier than ever. Why? Because UNO All Wild has made me the neighborhood UNO guru. People come for the game, stay for the hilarity.As for attractiveness to women, let's just say, nothing says charm like playing a 'Wild Reverse' card when she expects a compliment. Who knew UNO could be a love potion?In conclusion, UNO All Wild is not just a card game; it's a wild ride through unexpected scenarios. If your life needs a dash of chaos and a sprinkle of laughter, this deck is your golden ticket.Please appreciate this review with a chuckle and consider inviting UNO All Wild to your next game night. Your positive feedback might just fund my UNO addiction! ðŸŒŸðŸ˜‚","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024"

"5","UNO All Wild Card Game with 112 Cards, Gift for Kid, Family & Adult Game Night for Players 7 Years & Older, HHL33","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","gabby","I bought this game as a gift for my family and we had a blast playing it. Itâ€™s basically UNO with all wild cards, which means you can change the color or make someone draw cards at any time. The game also comes with erasable wild cards that you can customize with your own rules for added excitement. We had some hilarious moments with these cards, like making someone sing a song or do a dance.The game is easy to learn and play, and itâ€™s suitable for ages 7 and up. Itâ€™s great for family nights, parties, or just passing the time. The cards are good quality and durable, and they come in a nice box thatâ€™s easy to store.The only downside I can think of is that the game can get chaotic and unpredictable, which might not be everyoneâ€™s cup of tea. Some people might prefer the original UNO with more structure and strategy. Also, some of the erasable wild cards were hard to write on or erase completely.Overall, I think this is a fun and creative variation of UNO that adds more spice and laughter to the game. If youâ€™re looking for something different and exciting to play with your friends or family, I recommend giving this game a try.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 July 2023"

Becomes very confusing and you donâ€™t get the good game of uno like you do with the normal game. Played a few times but always end up going back to the original","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024"

Itâ€™s basically UNO with all wild cards, which means you can change the color or make someone draw cards at any time. The game also comes with erasable wild cards that you can customize with your own rules for added excitement. We had some hilarious moments with these cards, like making someone sing a song or do a dance.The game is easy to learn and play, and itâ€™s suitable for ages 7 and up. Itâ€™s great for family nights, parties, or just passing the time. The cards are good quality and durable, and they come in a nice box thatâ€™s easy to store.The only downside I can think of is that the game can get chaotic and unpredictable, which might not be everyoneâ€™s cup of tea. Some people might prefer the original UNO with more structure and strategy. Also, some of the erasable wild cards were hard to write on or erase completely.Overall, I think this is a fun and creative variation of UNO that adds more spice and laughter to the game. If youâ€™re looking for something different and exciting to play with your friends or family, I recommend giving this game a try.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 July 2023"
