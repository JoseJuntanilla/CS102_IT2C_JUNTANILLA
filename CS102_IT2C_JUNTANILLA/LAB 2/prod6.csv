"6","McAfee Total Protection 2024, 3 Devices | Antivirus, VPN, Password Manager, Mobile and Internet Security | PC/Mac/iOS/Android|1 Year Subscription | Activation Code by email","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Andrei","I bought this product and it and from start to finish I have had problems. After I downloaded it, I ran a scan, but my laptop kept restarting after it was only 50% (approx) through the scan. I got in touch with McAfee and at the beginning they were very helpful.They asked if they could remotely take control of my laptop so they could identify the issue. I agreed. The operator was doing something with my windows (think trying to update it) but then the laptop done an automatic restart (we were disconnected).I got in touch with the operator again and informed them that we had been disconnected due to my laptop restart. They once again took remote control and again it done a restart disconnecting us!I again got in touch, but it took me ages to get through to someone on their helpline. They kept sending me emails saying that my Service Request  number would be closed if I didn't get in touch. I have tried and tried but to no avail!!The customer care has been really really poor and I now have a laptop now that just continues to restart all the time (not even when I conduct a scan) and I cant even switched it on. My laptop is now completely useless!!I would strongly advice against buying this product for 2 reasons:1. The scan wouldn't run and ended up damaging my laptop (if you have downloaded this product please try and run a scan).2. The customer care has been woeful and extremely difficult to get in touch with almost impossible.Please stay away from this product!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2024"
