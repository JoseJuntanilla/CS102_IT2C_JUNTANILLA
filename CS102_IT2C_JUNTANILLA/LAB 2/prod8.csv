"1","Bitdefender Total Security 2024 - 10 Device | 1 year Subscription | PC/Mac | Activation Code by Post","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Mr. P. L. Lawrence","I have used Bitdefender for many years with its low impact on my system hardware speed but a high level of protection. If you switch on all of the protection, it even protects against ransomware which has been very high profile in the news lately. The installation process is painless and this version can protect 10 devices that include smartphones and tablets.  Amazon is cheaper than buying from Bitdefender directly, something their sales desk admits.  All of the PC test reviews I have looked at agree that its detection rates and more importantly what it does when it finds something, is the best of the best and it has saved me from problems many times when surfing the net. Sometimes this is because website designers have not been too careful about how they have assembled their sites. A well-known UK supermarket always flashes up warnings genuinely but I am protected against those bad elements in real-time by Bitdefender so I can still get my order done in safely. This is one purchase you will not regret.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2023"

"10","Bitdefender Total Security 2024 - 10 Device | 1 year Subscription | PC/Mac | Activation Code by Post","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","I never thought I would ever say that a program like Bitdefender could be annoying.  I had a paid version of Kaspersky prior to bitdefender and that wasn't as annoying.  Bitdefender continually sends notifications asking me to turn on the VPN, I get that they want to make more money but I already have surfshark so I ain't interested and I cannot find a way to switch them off.  Secondly the other day I get a notification telling me my phone was at risk, I go into bitdefender to run a scan after seeing another message saying we are aware of malware on your device.  So I run a scan after which I get the message your device was clean no malware found, but why don't you switch on our VPN... It's a bit like a cheap Chinese knock-off program, fairly regularly I get notifications about the VPN thing or some other stuff to try to get me to pay for paid add ons to the software.Another annoying thing is that I am being asked to turn on scam alert so I pressed the button to turn it on and I'm informed that I need to authorise something in settings.  There's a button which I need to click on and that supposedly will take me to the area in settings where I need to be be, I do this and I am brought back to the original page which is telling me that scam alert needs to be turned on.  This seems to be a never-ending circle as it never gets me into settings.  I report it and they want screenshot after screenshot after screenshot... That's a whole story in itself!I want a security program to run in the background to not be intrusive unless there is a definite attack on my phone or my PC and to be able to switch certain areas on or off without going round and round in circles.I don't want it popping up all the time like a delboy salesman try to sell me something that I don't need or want.

"50","Bitdefender Total Security 2024 - 10 Device | 1 year Subscription | PC/Mac | Activation Code by Post","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","I never thought I would ever say that a program like Bitdefender could be annoying.  I had a paid version of Kaspersky prior to bitdefender and that wasn't as annoying.  Bitdefender continually sends notifications asking me to turn on the VPN, I get that they want to make more money but I already have surfshark so I ain't interested and I cannot find a way to switch them off.  Secondly the other day I get a notification telling me my phone was at risk, I go into bitdefender to run a scan after seeing another message saying we are aware of malware on your device.  So I run a scan after which I get the message your device was clean no malware found, but why don't you switch on our VPN... It's a bit like a cheap Chinese knock-off program, fairly regularly I get notifications about the VPN thing or some other stuff to try to get me to pay for paid add ons to the software.Another annoying thing is that I am being asked to turn on scam alert so I pressed the button to turn it on and I'm informed that I need to authorise something in settings.  There's a button which I need to click on and that supposedly will take me to the area in settings where I need to be be, I do this and I am brought back to the original page which is telling me that scam alert needs to be turned on.  This seems to be a never-ending circle as it never gets me into settings.  I report it and they want screenshot after screenshot after screenshot... That's a whole story in itself!I want a security program to run in the background to not be intrusive unless there is a definite attack on my phone or my PC and to be able to switch certain areas on or off without going round and round in circles.I don't want it popping up all the time like a delboy salesman try to sell me something that I don't need or want.  Enough said!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 December 2021"
