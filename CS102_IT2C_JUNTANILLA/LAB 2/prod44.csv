This game absolutely deserves a sparkling 5 out of 5 stars for the endless giggles and pure entertainment it brought to our gathering.First and foremost, the concept of the game is simply genius. The dark humor and witty prompts had us in stitches right from the beginning. We found ourselves engaged in a flurry of hilariously absurd scenarios and answering outrageous questions. The game brilliantly taps into our sense of humor and thrives on the unexpected, delivering non-stop laughter that can brighten up any gathering.Furthermore, the game's unique combination of strategy and humor kept us on our toes throughout. The strategy element adds an additional layer of excitement and competitiveness, making each round more thrilling and unpredictable. It's not just about having a good laugh, but also about outsmarting your opponents and strategically navigating through the game's twists and turns.The quality of the game components is also worth mentioning. The cards are durably made and the illustrations are cleverly designed. The writing on the cards is hilarious and ensures that every draw is a surprise waiting to be unveiled. The game rules are easy to follow, allowing us to dive right into the fun without any confusion or delays.All in all, Ginger Fox's ""We're All Gonna Die"" party game is an absolute riot. Our game night was filled with uncontrollable laughter, and we cannot recommend this game enough for a memorable and laughter-filled gathering with friends. If you're looking to add a dose of hilarity to your next game night, this game is an absolute must-have. Prepare to laugh until it hurts!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 November 2023"

If you've got people around, then this game is absolutely hilarious and relies on innuendo and simplicity.Deal out all the cards to everyone that is playing. You then look through your cards and take turns at finding pairs, and then shout them out and place then face up on the table. Then you take turns at going around the table to ask people if they have the other card to the one you might need to make a pair.The aim of the game is to avoid having the ""Don‚Äôt be a Dik Dik"" card in your possession at the end, whereby the only solution is to play ""Don‚Äôt be a Dik Dik roulette"" and take cards off the other remaining player!It's a great game for camping, journeys, parties and nights in.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2023"

This game has been a source of much laughter and amusement, with a few caveats.The game's humor is its biggest draw. It's cheeky, playful, and often outright hilarious. The first game night with this card deck was an absolute riot, with everyone engaged and enjoying the novelty and wit of each card. The design and quality of the cards are excellent, contributing to an enjoyable gaming experience.Replayability is a strong point of 'Don't Be A Dik Dik.' You can bring it out on multiple occasions, and it's easy to get into the fun without lengthy explanations or setups. It's a great icebreaker and a fantastic way to inject some light-heartedness into an evening.However, the humor, while a significant plus, does tend to lose a bit of its charm after the first playthrough. The surprise element of the jokes and scenarios diminishes, which is common with humor-centered games. While it remains enjoyable, the repeat rounds aren't quite as uproarious as the initial experience.Also, it's worth noting the game's content leans towards adult humor. It's perfect for a night in with friends but might raise a few eyebrows in more conservative or family-oriented gatherings. It's all about knowing your audience with this one.Despite this, the game's quality, ease of play, and the sheer fun factor keep it high on my list. 'Don't Be A Dik Dik' is durable, well-crafted, and sure to bring laughter, even if it's a bit less surprising after the first round.In conclusion, the Ginger Fox 'Don't Be A Dik Dik' card game is a fantastic choice for those looking for an entertaining, adult-themed game. It's a solid 4-star game that promises and delivers many fun evenings, even if the humor becomes slightly more familiar over time. It's a staple for any game night that's not afraid of a little playful cheekiness!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 November 2023"
