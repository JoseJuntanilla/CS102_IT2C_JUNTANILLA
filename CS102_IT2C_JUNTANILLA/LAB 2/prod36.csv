"1","Lifesystems Pocket First Aid Kit, CE Certified Contents, Specifically Designed for Hiking and Outdoor","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Outdoor Adventures","Would recommend, perfect size. Belt clip has a Velcro and stud to ensure this stays secure.I’ve added additional plasters and paracetamol, Ibuprofen too, there’s even room for a chapstick. There’s is a little additional space for these items if you cut the tablet to size.A really handy piece of kit for the car, walking or travelling about. Handy to have around the home too.Well worth the price, love how everything packs in so well. Bought this over the more robust kits on Amazon as this stands up to BSE standards.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 June 2020"
"2","Lifesystems Pocket First Aid Kit, CE Certified Contents, Specifically Designed for Hiking and Outdoor","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Hendri","I bought this for a bug out bag and it has everything I would expect or need from a compact first aid kit.Components seem good quality and it fits inside the fixed side pocket of a Maxpedition Monsoon backpack perfectly although it is a tight fit - certainly no room for anything else in there.I chose this kit specifically for that pocket and although the stated size is just larger than the pocket dimensions it will squash down slightly to fit inside no problem.Very pleased with this and it was a good price too - just hope I never need to use it.....","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2023"
"3","Lifesystems Pocket First Aid Kit, CE Certified Contents, Specifically Designed for Hiking and Outdoor","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Outdoor Adventures","This is a reasonably well thought out first aid kit.Pros:Easy to carry size, with space to add your own gear in. I've added a small pill bottle (with pills containing ibuprofen, parcetamol, aspirin, anti indigestion, caffeine & antihistamine tablets), condoms, hangover sachets and waterproof plasters, with space for a couple of extra items if needed (may add an aluminium blanket & ear plugs)Cons:Would have been nice to have it waterproof, they've got the waterproof zip on it, surely it wouldn't take much of a change or cost to do so as it's such of a small item and Lifesystems do make large waterproof versions, it would be nice for them to extend this feature to the rest of their range.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 June 2020"
