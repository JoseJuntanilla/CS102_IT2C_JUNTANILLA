"1","Three Barrels Rare Old French Brandy VSOP, 70cl","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","Have used Kaspersky security year on year and my devices have had perfect protection. Great value for money and easy to install using the code purchased, never experienced any problems.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2024"
"2","Three Barrels Rare Old French Brandy VSOP, 70cl","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","BJ","Always get it from Amazon. Never auto renewal or purchase directly from Kaspersky as they always charge you more","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 December 2023"
"3","Three Barrels Rare Old French Brandy VSOP, 70cl","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","Kaspersky total security is my favourite of the all in one security packages and this is my 4th year using it. Always uninstall and buy digitally from amazon - it’s about 1/3 the price of renewing.Not much has changed this year - same great product with a slightly (very slightly) updated user interface. New this year so far seems to be an improved software updater that’s a nice touch.Reason I use this is that It regularly scores highest on malware tests, and as a bonus comes with actually useful tools like webcam blocker, the update checker, privacy and security optimisation browser plug-ins and such, and is very light on system resources - I don’t need to turn it off to game for example. I’ve bought a couple of computers that have come with trials of norton or trend micro and the just feel sub par by comparison.Minus 1 star from a perfect 5 for continuing to bundle kaspersky’s overpriced VPN software trial, and dumb region locking. The VPN can be removed post install by searching ‘add or remove programs’, but the region locking seemed particularly lazy.I didn’t notice when I bought this that it was UK only - that’s my bad, it says right on the page - but kaspersky’s enforcement is very lazy. I’m currently in Australia, but bought from the UK as my kaspersky account and payment card are still UK-based. It let me activate that serial fine (so no refund possibility) but then wouldn’t activate the software once downloaded even though the last one worked fine until the day before lol. They know my account, my history, my hardware, etc. it should work better. However all good as activated fine when using a VPN and no problems since with the VPN turned off.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2024"
