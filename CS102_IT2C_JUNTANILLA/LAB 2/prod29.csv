They don't disintegrate like cheaper brands and the jumbo sizing on the rolls mean they last a long time before needing replacing too. They're not the cheapest though and recent pricing has been a bit off-putting, but when they are priced normally, they're better value in my eyes than cheaper versions where you will end using more in the long-run.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2024"

It's very absorbent and very economical in use as a result.It's been  a essential in our household for a while and we have discovered all sorts of uses for it - mainly variations on the theme of mopping up spills,  as a substitute for cloths for cleaning work surfaces, for cleaning/polishing glassware but I've also used it to clean my specs,  apply polish to wood, car polish to my car and I've found it works great to staunch blood flow whilst I scrabble around for a sticking plaster.We buy 8 rolls a month via Amazon subscribe and save which makes for a more economic purchase than using any other source we know of.  I'm always amazed how we manage to get through that many rolls in a typical month but we do - amazingly we even had to buy a couple of extra rolls from a local supermarket over Christmas. So we are great fans.We are NOT great fans of Amazon's method of packing this stuff for delivery.We had our monthly delivery of subscribe and save items yesterday and today.  Both deliveries came via a Amazon e-van. Whilst I don't entirely believe the propoganda re electric vehicles, broadly speaking I guess this is better than diesel and also good for Amazon's eco credentials.Saturday's delivery included a pack of 48 Andrex toilet rolls. This pack has aprroximately twice the volume occupied by the Regina kitchen towel 8 pack.  The Andrex loo rolls just  came shrink wrapped with  a label identifying me and my address.  This is definitely eco-friendly as packaging was minimal.Today's  (and previous deliveries) of the Regina product use packagng which verges on the absurd.As previously. the kitchen rolls arrived packed in a huge cardboard box of roughly twice the volume needed. Even more absurd, the unused space was filled with something like 25 yards of paper wrap. Amazon PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop this nonsense.  It's wholly unneccesary, definitley eco-unfriendly and also wastes my time as I have to cut up all this redundant packaging so that it can fit it in our green bin - and and it takes up far too much volume in the latter.Could someone explain why Regina kitchen towels need to be hidden from prying eyes in a box whilst the toilet rolls - being wrapped in transaprent plastic - are not.

The long-lasting quality and cost-effective nature of this product make it a staple in my kitchen, and I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable and efficient kitchen/household roll.One of the standout features of the Regina Blitz Household Towel is its remarkable durability and consistent performance. Unlike other brands that seem to change with every iteration, Regina Blitz has remained steadfast in delivering exceptional quality over the years. From spills to general cleaning, this household product does exactly what it claims to do, and it continues to impress me with its strength, super absorbency, and overall fuss-free functionality.Having experienced the unparalleled effectiveness, I can confidently say that it's a product you don't want to miss out on. The initial price may seem steep, but the long-term cost-effectiveness is undeniable. The value and performance justify the investment, especially when purchasing through Amazon, where the price is more than justified for the quantity and quality you receive.It's worth noting that Regina Blitz offers other products similar to this one, but based on my experience, they don't quite match up in terms of quality. Don't be swayed by imitations; stick with the original Regina Blitz Household Towel for the superior performance you deserve.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2023"

They don't disintegrate like cheaper brands and the jumbo sizing on the rolls mean they last a long time before needing replacing too. They're not the cheapest though and recent pricing has been a bit off-putting, but when they are priced normally, they're better value in my eyes than cheaper versions where you will end using more in the long-run.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2024"

It's very absorbent and very economical in use as a result.It's been  a essential in our household for a while and we have discovered all sorts of uses for it - mainly variations on the theme of mopping up spills,  as a substitute for cloths for cleaning work surfaces, for cleaning/polishing glassware but I've also used it to clean my specs,  apply polish to wood, car polish to my car and I've found it works great to staunch blood flow whilst I scrabble around for a sticking plaster.We buy 8 rolls a month via Amazon subscribe and save which makes for a more economic purchase than using any other source we know of.  I'm always amazed how we manage to get through that many rolls in a typical month but we do - amazingly we even had to buy a couple of extra rolls from a local supermarket over Christmas. So we are great fans.We are NOT great fans of Amazon's method of packing this stuff for delivery.We had our monthly delivery of subscribe and save items yesterday and today.  Both deliveries came via a Amazon e-van. Whilst I don't entirely believe the propoganda re electric vehicles, broadly speaking I guess this is better than diesel and also good for Amazon's eco credentials.Saturday's delivery included a pack of 48 Andrex toilet rolls. This pack has aprroximately twice the volume occupied by the Regina kitchen towel 8 pack.  The Andrex loo rolls just  came shrink wrapped with  a label identifying me and my address.  This is definitely eco-friendly as packaging was minimal.Today's  (and previous deliveries) of the Regina product use packagng which verges on the absurd.As previously. the kitchen rolls arrived packed in a huge cardboard box of roughly twice the volume needed. Even more absurd, the unused space was filled with something like 25 yards of paper wrap. Amazon PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop this nonsense.  It's wholly unneccesary, definitley eco-unfriendly and also wastes my time as I have to cut up all this redundant packaging so that it can fit it in our green bin - and and it takes up far too much volume in the latter.Could someone explain why Regina kitchen towels need to be hidden from prying eyes in a box whilst the toilet rolls - being wrapped in transaprent plastic - are not.
