"1","HG Mould Spray, Effective Mould Spray & Mildew Cleaner, Removes Mouldy Stains From Walls, Tiles, Silicone Seals & More - 500ml","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","I never review things unless they really are good. This stuff stinks to high heaven (strong bleach smell) but it got the black mould we found behind a chest of drawers off completely. There literally isn't a trace of it left at all. I sprayed it liberally. Left if for an hour or so, then wiped it down and about half had gone. Then I re sprayed it and left it again. This time I walked back in to the 2nd pic. Ou can see the wall is still a bit wet from the spray but the mould was completely gone. Can't say fairer than that. I also used it on our bathroom sealant round the bath which I had previously scrubbed over and over, and again it worked wonders. It didnt 100% remove all the black stains on the sealant and tiles, but it got 95% of it. It looks souch better. Brilliant stuff. Just make sure you wear a mask and ventilate the heck out of the rooms you are spraying. Takes a good 12 hours to smell normal again.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"

This was easy to apply. I left it to soak in and when I went to clean it off, most of the mould had already disappeared. Very pleased with the result. The smell of bleach was pretty strong but was pretty much gone by the next day.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2024"
"3","HG Mould Spray, Effective Mould Spray & Mildew Cleaner, Removes Mouldy Stains From Walls, Tiles, Silicone Seals & More - 500ml","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","Our bathroom condensation was getting so bad that mould was growing quickly in and above the shower. I was having to clean the mould in the shower with bleach and a toothbrush almost every week and couldn't reach the mould on the ceiling. It was getting to the point that I was embarrassed to have guests over!Ordered this and sprayed the whole shower and ceiling above the shower and left it. Whilst it does say to leave it 30 minutes, I was cooking at the time so left it longer. After a couple of hours I went to check and was amazed to find everything gleaming white, not a single speck of mould and no scrubbing involved!!! I rinsed it all with water (apart from the ceiling obviously) and whilst there is a strong smell of bleach in the bathroom, it's better than no smell and mould!So glad I bought this!! Wish I'd taken pictures now!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"
"4","HG Mould Spray, Effective Mould Spray & Mildew Cleaner, Removes Mouldy Stains From Walls, Tiles, Silicone Seals & More - 500ml","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","Having tried many, many mould sprays this is the only one that is really highly effective.I’ve used the spray on silicone sealant that I expected would require expensive replacement as dark black mould spots were present, but just a couple of applications and the mould disappeared altogether.Very deep, dark & large areas of mould which has penetrated throughout the sealant may not disappear or several applications, but will fade significantly.In addition to bathroom & kitchen sealant, I use it on discoloured grout, backs of furniture (with care not to soak, having tested an area first & not expensive/varnished items), window frames & seals, skirting boards, and bathroom/shower walls & ceilings (I don’t think it’s recommended for painted surfaces, but as no scrubbing is required it’s been absolutely fine on white emulsion-painted areas in my experience). Wherever possible I spray the area generously and leave overnight. Very deep/dark/large areas may require a second or even third application.It does have a strong chemical odour similar to strong bleach and care must be taken to protect from breathing in, spraying near eyes - especially ceilings, etc but taking common sense precautions is all that’s required e.g mask, goggles (a must if spraying at higher levels) and always ventilate the room by opening a window.I work in property management and attend many properties with condensation mould (20+ per year). This has been fantastic for dealing with mould issues quickly and easily.We also use this routinely for cleaning bathrooms (grout, sealant & ceilings) between tenancies as it saves so much time and expense as opposed to scrubbing grout with bleach and a toothbrush or worse still to remove and reapply sealant around baths, showers, basins, etc.In my own home I used to have the sealant replaced in the shower every 12-18 months. Since using this, it looks like new and keeps fresh for several years. Keeping on top of mould spots and spraying as they arise prevents the requirement for multiple applications, results are speedy and it makes one bottle last forever!I’ve only dropped one star as the product takes several hours to do its magic so further application(s) (and property visits in the case of work) might be required. The odour is significant when working with large areas of mould…but, I’m just being strict in case people are highly sensitive to the strong chemical odour or expect one squirt to perform miracles within seconds. The safety catch above the trigger is a bit fiddly but an essential safety feature for child-safety and accidents. The internal tube now needs inserting prior to first use, which again is fiddly, but a good feature to prevent the tube being damaged by the chemical if it’s left to sit in the bottle for a long time before use - as has happened in the past.These are just my own personal experiences and opinions. Hope it helps!If there was an option I’d rate it 4.5/5","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024"

In the past, we have tried different mixtures from vinegar, bleach, other mould sprays plus have used a dehumidifier along with £1 damp boxes in nooks and crannies alas we have a constant battle with the black stuff! Every year we dread autumn through to spring, but this year we found this spray and it has been a game changer.We have mainly used it on walls, grout and windows and this little bottle has cut out hours of scrubbing and lots of stress and worry. I don’t like the idea use of using chemicals but it really worries me about the health effects the damp has on my family and this £5 product has made a significant impact on our lengthy battle with trying to keep it away.

I have NEVER seen anything see off mould as fast, ever! We live in an apartment, south facing, which is great in summer, but in the winter all the doors are battened down and vents closed to keep the heat in as the wind hits us straight off the Pennines. Result? Mould around the edges of the windows due to condensation. This product removed it in seconds! Rather than spray directly onto the mould, I sprayed a little on a damp cloth which was going straight in the bin afterwards. Wiped it over the mould, did the same again a few seconds later and.....GONE!!! Wiped it down with a clean wet cloth, then a dry one.It smells a bit, so keep the windows open!Would I recommend it?

This stuff stinks to high heaven (strong bleach smell) but it got the black mould we found behind a chest of drawers off completely. There literally isn't a trace of it left at all. I sprayed it liberally. Left if for an hour or so, then wiped it down and about half had gone. Then I re sprayed it and left it again. This time I walked back in to the 2nd pic. Ou can see the wall is still a bit wet from the spray but the mould was completely gone. Can't say fairer than that. I also used it on our bathroom sealant round the bath which I had previously scrubbed over and over, and again it worked wonders. It didnt 100% remove all the black stains on the sealant and tiles, but it got 95% of it. It looks souch better. Brilliant stuff. Just make sure you wear a mask and ventilate the heck out of the rooms you are spraying. Takes a good 12 hours to smell normal again.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"

I was having to clean the mould in the shower with bleach and a toothbrush almost every week and couldn't reach the mould on the ceiling. It was getting to the point that I was embarrassed to have guests over!Ordered this and sprayed the whole shower and ceiling above the shower and left it. Whilst it does say to leave it 30 minutes, I was cooking at the time so left it longer. After a couple of hours I went to check and was amazed to find everything gleaming white, not a single speck of mould and no scrubbing involved!!! I rinsed it all with water (apart from the ceiling obviously) and whilst there is a strong smell of bleach in the bathroom, it's better than no smell and mould!So glad I bought this!!

"34","HG Mould Spray, Effective Mould Spray & Mildew Cleaner, Removes Mouldy Stains From Walls, Tiles, Silicone Seals & More - 500ml","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","Having tried many, many mould sprays this is the only one that is really highly effective.I’ve used the spray on silicone sealant that I expected would require expensive replacement as dark black mould spots were present, but just a couple of applications and the mould disappeared altogether.Very deep, dark & large areas of mould which has penetrated throughout the sealant may not disappear or several applications, but will fade significantly.In addition to bathroom & kitchen sealant, I use it on discoloured grout, backs of furniture (with care not to soak, having tested an area first & not expensive/varnished items), window frames & seals, skirting boards, and bathroom/shower walls & ceilings (I don’t think it’s recommended for painted surfaces, but as no scrubbing is required it’s been absolutely fine on white emulsion-painted areas in my experience). Wherever possible I spray the area generously and leave overnight. Very deep/dark/large areas may require a second or even third application.It does have a strong chemical odour similar to strong bleach and care must be taken to protect from breathing in, spraying near eyes - especially ceilings, etc but taking common sense precautions is all that’s required e.g mask, goggles (a must if spraying at higher levels) and always ventilate the room by opening a window.I work in property management and attend many properties with condensation mould (20+ per year). This has been fantastic for dealing with mould issues quickly and easily.We also use this routinely for cleaning bathrooms (grout, sealant & ceilings) between tenancies as it saves so much time and expense as opposed to scrubbing grout with bleach and a toothbrush or worse still to remove and reapply sealant around baths, showers, basins, etc.In my own home I used to have the sealant replaced in the shower every 12-18 months. Since using this, it looks like new and keeps fresh for several years. Keeping on top of mould spots and spraying as they arise prevents the requirement for multiple applications, results are speedy and it makes one bottle last forever!I’ve only dropped one star as the product takes several hours to do its magic so further application(s) (and property visits in the case of work) might be required. The odour is significant when working with large areas of mould…but, I’m just being strict in case people are highly sensitive to the strong chemical odour or expect one squirt to perform miracles within seconds. The safety catch above the trigger is a bit fiddly but an essential safety feature for child-safety and accidents. The internal tube now needs inserting prior to first use, which again is fiddly, but a good feature to prevent the tube being damaged by the chemical if it’s left to sit in the bottle for a long time before use - as has happened in the past.These are just my own personal experiences and opinions. Hope it helps!If there was an option I’d rate it 4.5/5","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024"
