"3","Woodford Reserve Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Martin Westacott","Nom Nom Nom, a wonderful gentle flavour for casual consumption on a freezing cold eveningI had a sample and decided that this is the first Bourbon which I found acceptable, cannot stand the market leaders.I prefer real Scotch; but this is a gentle flavour, a great aroma, smooth on the nose and the palette, I do like a single ice cube, as I prefer my spirits cold, have lived in a few deserts.This also soothed my sore throat after hollering instructions all day on a freezing cold Steam Train.Heaven!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 February 2024"

"5","Woodford Reserve Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","CjW & KjW","I'm a Scotch lover with a particular penchant for the Islay offerings, so bourbon is a fairly new world to me. That said, I'd like to hope my palate is developed enough that I can pick up on a good amount of the tasting notes in a whisky.Woodford Reserve has such a stunning reputation and seems to be regarded as one of the top bourbons, especially at this price point. If I'm being brutally honest, I really don't see what all the fuss is about! It's not an unpleasant drink by any means, it's just entirely uninspiring. My first foray into bourbon was Buffalo Trace which I loved and it showed me just how much better American whisky can be than the typical Jack Daniels No. 7 (which I find absolutely disgusting). After that I tried Bulleit which was incredible too. Such a shame that I've heard Woodford touted above these two so many times and it ended up being such a let down.Nose: Vanilla, vanilla and more vanilla. I honestly get barely anything else except maybe the tiniest hint of banana.Palate: There's that vanilla again but this time a little toffee creeps in along with the classic oak bed bourbons are so often built on. There's a faint bit of chocolate and that banana from the nose again as well as something not unlike tobacco. Again incredibly faint and a little flat. It's very smooth but there is quite the burn leading into the finish. A couple of drops of water might well help but the other  flavours are so faint I'm afraid they'll end up lost entirely.Finish: This is where I have to give credit. The finish is completely butterscotch and very, very long. It takes me back to my childhood when my grandmother would share her Werther's Originals with me and that is what this finish is full of. It's just a shame the lead up to it was so average and there was such a bite on the end of a smooth palate that I had to get over before reaching it.All in all? An okay bourbon but in my personal opinion one that doesn't warrant half the praise it receives. Maybe I need to try more bourbons and go back to it with more experience. This is a 3 star whisky in nose and taste to me but the finish was so long and provoked such an emotive response from me that I had to add a star. That said, I'd skip this one and give Bulleit a try instead.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2023"
"6","Woodford Reserve Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Kevin Liddle","Literally one of the best bourbons I've tried. Has a nice smokiness to it, but not overpowering and a gentle honey sweetness that compliments it nicely. Either used for cocktails or just drinking neat, still a very nice bourbon to enjoy.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2024"
