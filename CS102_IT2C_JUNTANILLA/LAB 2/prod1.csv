Always used Kaspersky in the past for protection of my android mobile and a laptop, but the events of the last year have turned me away from that brand. So far the Norton is working well with no problem. Comprehensive virus protection and piece of mind at a great price.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2024"

Simple delivery of product key by Amazon and download/install is simple. BUT beware of the automatic renewal at around £90. Seems to be a very unfair price compared to the new purchase price and you will have to give your card details at the start. You can cancel automatic renewal and buy again from Amazon. The renewal installation can be done through your account on Norton.com.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2024"

Waller","Simple and easy to install across several machines/phones even some on different platforms. I have installed my licence on iPhone, iPad, MacBook and a windows 10 PC and the process of installation was fairly simple. Although I did have to uninstall an old licence installation to enable this one to download and install. Again this was a fairly simple process. It would be useful if there was a simplified explanation of what some of the features did and how they affect day-to-day operation to us non-techies as you go through the set-up as some of the warnings can be quite off putting - e.g. VPN (I know what it means but not how it would affect me). Otherwise I am impressed with how it works and how it protects me from malicious malware, cyber attacks, etc.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 October 2023"
"6","Norton 360 Deluxe 2024, Antivirus software for 5 Devices and 1-year subscription with automatic renewal, Includes Secure VPN and Password Manager, PC/Mac/iOS/Android, Activation Code by email","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Catalina","Forgot not to use this after the hassle last time, This is a good product once in use, but Norton have ruined it with sketchy practices, after buying it they then insist you subscribe and enter your payment details and agree to auto renew at extortionate prices in the hope you forget, this is also made clear as they offer free additional services to you such as a pc tune up so long as you leave your auto renewal active, I cannot abide this kind of underhand behaviour, it was quite difficult to find where to cancel the auto renew last time aswel, they certainly don’t make it easy for you, this time however having forgotten all this before purchase I wasn’t even able to activate it, it would not accept my payment details citing I had to change country?! or change my payment method, both of which were correct, and every time I tried I would receive a bank notification on my phone saying that Norton had taken out £0.01 each time, so clearly the details were correct, but I was stuck on this page with no option to continue, so I’m not going to waste more time on it, shouldn’t be having to troubleshoot like this on the first hurdle, I just hope that these £0.01 transactions from Norton won’t come back to haunt me in a years time.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2024"
"7","Norton 360 Deluxe 2024, Antivirus software for 5 Devices and 1-year subscription with automatic renewal, Includes Secure VPN and Password Manager, PC/Mac/iOS/Android, Activation Code by email","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","G-Tay","I have been using Norton for many years and, overall, I am very pleased with it. However, what really annoys me is the cost for auto renewal. In round numbers (I hate messing around with all these 99p) renewal was going to cost me £90.  When  I hadn’t renewed within a couple of weeks of the expiry date Norton sent a special offer of just £30. However, I then realised I could buy the product again at just £13. It did take slightly longer to install but the saving was worth the time.I immediately turned off auto renew on the newly purchased product. Two months later I received an email saying that if I switched on auto renew I would get an extra 3 months of cover. This I have done and made a note to switch it off again just before the renewal date. Then the whole cycle starts again.To summarise I could have renewed for 12 months for £90. Instead I have purchased new cover for 15months for £13.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2024"
"8","Norton 360 Deluxe 2024, Antivirus software for 5 Devices and 1-year subscription with automatic renewal, Includes Secure VPN and Password Manager, PC/Mac/iOS/Android, Activation Code by email","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","JosAber","Good security software let down by far too many issues.1. The probelm that everyone complains about. That you need to input your card details or you cannot activate the product. There are no words of that kind of behaviour.2. About the system to claim on the Norton guarantee of a refund if they cannot remove a virus. You have to be subscribed to automatic renewal. If you put your card details in to activate Norton, which initiates automatic renewal, then cancel automatic renewal. You can't use the guarantee.3. The app is flaky. When you move your mouse over any of the Norton windows that are open, your mouse lags. It makes using the app, unpleasant.4. If you have your PC on for a few hours the VPN on/off button stops working, forcing you to reboot to gain control.5. I was pleased about the back up data allowance. I figured I might want to back up the odd picture/document. Only to be extremely disappointed. When I went to look at this feature, it required being set-up. At the start of this process, it asked if I wanted to back up all my pictures on my PC. Declining means not being able to use the back-up system.6. Installing add on security features like Norton Safe Search is not user friendly. If you add 'safe-search' it affects something I use often. E.g. you are on a webpage and see a line of text you want to google. You can left-click and drag across it, then right click on it. Then there is an option to search google for that highlighted text. With Safe-Search enabled, Norton takes that over and displays Norton results and not Google results. I.e. changing your search engine. I have had to revert back to copying text I want to search on, and paste it into google.This is a far as I got. I gave up installing add-ons of any kind, because I could not be bothered with the hassle. Very likely I would not have liked how other features operate. There are a few features I am not even trying to use. To a certain extent I gave up exploring other general options too.The VPN is handy if you want to view region restricted content. However using a VPN on a regular basis is somewhat a pain. Wesites load noticabely slower. Some websites are blocked to VPNs, because VPN anonimity is what hackers use. Amazon Priome Video is 50/50 whether it will let you stream with the VPN on. If yu use the VPN day-today, you may have to turn it off to use Amazon Prime Video. ... Whereas other brand/manufacturer VPNs are fine.There are far too many pop-ups in the lower right side of your monitor. I don't mean good advice like 'this file is safe etc'. I mean stuff about do you want to buy a product to stop tracking cookies? Adverts and more than one type. Sometimes you'll get three over short period of time, and be swearing at having to close irritating ad pop-ups. Like what the hell is Norton doing contacting me on my PC desktop experience?","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024"
"9","Norton 360 Deluxe 2024, Antivirus software for 5 Devices and 1-year subscription with automatic renewal, Includes Secure VPN and Password Manager, PC/Mac/iOS/Android, Activation Code by email","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","meandher","I’ve used Norton for several years as it seems an ok product. HOWEVER, Norton as a company continues to engage in some of the most egregious business practices to catch out those who are less tech savvy, so they are potentially, and unwittingly, hit with the full £90 (at time of writing) annual renewal fee or cajoled into paying for additional add-ons.The pros:In my time using Norton my pc has never, as far as I’m aware, caught a virus.It is easy to open and run a scan.The cons:Where to begin (!). As many reviews state you should always deactivate the auto renewal and buy a new license key at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately Norton make activating a new key this way as labyrinthine as possible. The online help will tell you to go to a settings page in your current installation of Norton and put in the new key. However, if you have disabled auto renew this method will show an error code that will force you to log in to the main website. Here, to activate your new key Norton will insist that you enter your credit card details and enable auto renew before you then can (& have) to download a new install of the app (that you already have installed on your pc) before it will activate. This also means you will lose any remaining time on your current Norton install as it doesn’t link the subscriptions.The autorenewal - Since I last installed this Norton appear to have changed the fine print so that if you have deactivated the annual auto-renewal  you also lose access to a number of features including the much vaunted “Virus Protection Promise” I.e. if your pc does get a virus…you have no recourse to Norton unless you’ve pre-agreed to let them charge you £90 next year, in advance. This makes no sense if you think about it. If you’re thinking all you’ll do is set a reminder to cancel the auto-renewal a couple of weeks or a month before the renewal date, Norton have also changed the fine print to state that they will take the next payment 35 days in advance (note that time period, as it’s before you start getting pop-up reminders ).The pop-ups/add-ons - once installed you will be hit with constant pop ups trying to upsell additional features and add-ins. Or pseudo-“critical’ notifications in red : “YOU HAVE X BROKEN REGISTRY ENTRIES- FIX NOW?” That, if clicked will take you to a page asking you to confirm the purchase of said add-on…. And they already have your credit card details from the setup process so, again, I can see how those less technically inclined can have unwitting added £20+ on to their annual subscription without even realising. You can turn these pop ups off but in reality they just seem to ‘snooze’ eventually coming back after a few days.In summary, yes, the core product seems to work well enough but the fact I have to put so much active effort in to avoiding being ripped off, or inadvertently charged additional costs makes me question Norton’s ethics and integrity as a company. Ultimately this will be the last time I  use them as there are alternatives out there, and it’s at the point now where it’s easier to go with a different product each year than trying to navigate Nortons renewal process.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023"

I was worried that maybe there is a catch but so far everything is good. I’ve installed it with no problem and it works perfectly. As other users have said: they do ask for bank/PayPal details so that they can automatically renew next year but they ask you for that when you buy directly from Norton and I just switch off renewal 35 days before expiry. You can also switch it off as soon as you installed the product but I keep mine for as long as I can because of a Virus Removal Service that only applies if you are enrolled into automatic renewal.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024"

The subscription may maybe too expensive after the first year (around £80).  The UI is very clean. The user experience is overall positive.I don't like the internal self-promotion popups (e.g. Automatic driver installations). It shows for instance your outdated drivers then would offer you a two-month trial period where you would have to enter your card details again (+£40 subscription). Just add the feature to the bundle. It gives a feeling of an in-app purchase feature or that the antivirus is incomplete.Norton is a great antivirus. They managed to clean the bad rep they had a long time ago. I feel this antivirus is superior to the others I tried (BitDefender, Avast, AV, Windows Defender, Panda...), however quite costly.On a security level, it is maybe on the same level as Kaspersky when it was safe to use.It is better than BitDefender for me because it didn't break Nodejs or Powershell.I removed one star for the subscription cost.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2024"

Easy to logon to my account and type in the serial number to activate the service and download to my devices - PC/Mac/2x iPhones/Android tablet etc.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 February 2024"

Much better value than buying direct from Norton. While you have to subscribe this can be turned off in your account. Internet/anti virus protection is essential. Norton is a bit of a 'marmite' product to some. Fortunately, we like marmite!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2024"
