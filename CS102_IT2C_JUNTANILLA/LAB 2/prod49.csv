"1","Cheatwell Games Fart Card Game","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","PandaPops","Bought as a gift. Simple instructions and she says she and her kids (7 & 9) have had a couple of very enjoyable plays, so it gets a thumbs up from her!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 September 2023"
"2","Cheatwell Games Fart Card Game","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Kerry","Very much like Uno. Is good fun to kill half an hour. The sound effects it asks you to make when playing a card isn't realistic and can actually make the game laborious if you choose to follow those rules! But...just play without doing it. Nice tin and it's a bit more refreshing from the more grown up card games.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 April 2022"
