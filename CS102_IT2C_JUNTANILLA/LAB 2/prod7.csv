Easy to navigate the menu. However, it has one quite annoying feature I have to put up with, every time when you use VPN it turns your own default searching engine (Google, in my case) into MA's own 'safety search' sponsored by Yahoo. You can manually switch it off in the browser settings, but doing it every time you use VPN ( and I use it frequently) is a pain in the neck. Apart from that it's a good safe piece of software.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2023"
