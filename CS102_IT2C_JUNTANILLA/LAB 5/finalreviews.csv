Always used Kaspersky in the past for protection of my android mobile and a laptop, but the events of the last year have turned me away from that brand. So far the Norton is working well with no problem. Comprehensive virus protection and piece of mind at a great price.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2024"

Simple delivery of product key by Amazon and download/install is simple. BUT beware of the automatic renewal at around £90. Seems to be a very unfair price compared to the new purchase price and you will have to give your card details at the start. You can cancel automatic renewal and buy again from Amazon. The renewal installation can be done through your account on Norton.com.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2024"

Waller","Simple and easy to install across several machines/phones even some on different platforms. I have installed my licence on iPhone, iPad, MacBook and a windows 10 PC and the process of installation was fairly simple. Although I did have to uninstall an old licence installation to enable this one to download and install. Again this was a fairly simple process. It would be useful if there was a simplified explanation of what some of the features did and how they affect day-to-day operation to us non-techies as you go through the set-up as some of the warnings can be quite off putting - e.g. VPN (I know what it means but not how it would affect me). Otherwise I am impressed with how it works and how it protects me from malicious malware, cyber attacks, etc.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 October 2023"
"6","Norton 360 Deluxe 2024, Antivirus software for 5 Devices and 1-year subscription with automatic renewal, Includes Secure VPN and Password Manager, PC/Mac/iOS/Android, Activation Code by email","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Catalina","Forgot not to use this after the hassle last time, This is a good product once in use, but Norton have ruined it with sketchy practices, after buying it they then insist you subscribe and enter your payment details and agree to auto renew at extortionate prices in the hope you forget, this is also made clear as they offer free additional services to you such as a pc tune up so long as you leave your auto renewal active, I cannot abide this kind of underhand behaviour, it was quite difficult to find where to cancel the auto renew last time aswel, they certainly don’t make it easy for you, this time however having forgotten all this before purchase I wasn’t even able to activate it, it would not accept my payment details citing I had to change country?! or change my payment method, both of which were correct, and every time I tried I would receive a bank notification on my phone saying that Norton had taken out £0.01 each time, so clearly the details were correct, but I was stuck on this page with no option to continue, so I’m not going to waste more time on it, shouldn’t be having to troubleshoot like this on the first hurdle, I just hope that these £0.01 transactions from Norton won’t come back to haunt me in a years time.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2024"
"7","Norton 360 Deluxe 2024, Antivirus software for 5 Devices and 1-year subscription with automatic renewal, Includes Secure VPN and Password Manager, PC/Mac/iOS/Android, Activation Code by email","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","G-Tay","I have been using Norton for many years and, overall, I am very pleased with it. However, what really annoys me is the cost for auto renewal. In round numbers (I hate messing around with all these 99p) renewal was going to cost me £90.  When  I hadn’t renewed within a couple of weeks of the expiry date Norton sent a special offer of just £30. However, I then realised I could buy the product again at just £13. It did take slightly longer to install but the saving was worth the time.I immediately turned off auto renew on the newly purchased product. Two months later I received an email saying that if I switched on auto renew I would get an extra 3 months of cover. This I have done and made a note to switch it off again just before the renewal date. Then the whole cycle starts again.To summarise I could have renewed for 12 months for £90. Instead I have purchased new cover for 15months for £13.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2024"
"8","Norton 360 Deluxe 2024, Antivirus software for 5 Devices and 1-year subscription with automatic renewal, Includes Secure VPN and Password Manager, PC/Mac/iOS/Android, Activation Code by email","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","JosAber","Good security software let down by far too many issues.1. The probelm that everyone complains about. That you need to input your card details or you cannot activate the product. There are no words of that kind of behaviour.2. About the system to claim on the Norton guarantee of a refund if they cannot remove a virus. You have to be subscribed to automatic renewal. If you put your card details in to activate Norton, which initiates automatic renewal, then cancel automatic renewal. You can't use the guarantee.3. The app is flaky. When you move your mouse over any of the Norton windows that are open, your mouse lags. It makes using the app, unpleasant.4. If you have your PC on for a few hours the VPN on/off button stops working, forcing you to reboot to gain control.5. I was pleased about the back up data allowance. I figured I might want to back up the odd picture/document. Only to be extremely disappointed. When I went to look at this feature, it required being set-up. At the start of this process, it asked if I wanted to back up all my pictures on my PC. Declining means not being able to use the back-up system.6. Installing add on security features like Norton Safe Search is not user friendly. If you add 'safe-search' it affects something I use often. E.g. you are on a webpage and see a line of text you want to google. You can left-click and drag across it, then right click on it. Then there is an option to search google for that highlighted text. With Safe-Search enabled, Norton takes that over and displays Norton results and not Google results. I.e. changing your search engine. I have had to revert back to copying text I want to search on, and paste it into google.This is a far as I got. I gave up installing add-ons of any kind, because I could not be bothered with the hassle. Very likely I would not have liked how other features operate. There are a few features I am not even trying to use. To a certain extent I gave up exploring other general options too.The VPN is handy if you want to view region restricted content. However using a VPN on a regular basis is somewhat a pain. Wesites load noticabely slower. Some websites are blocked to VPNs, because VPN anonimity is what hackers use. Amazon Priome Video is 50/50 whether it will let you stream with the VPN on. If yu use the VPN day-today, you may have to turn it off to use Amazon Prime Video. ... Whereas other brand/manufacturer VPNs are fine.There are far too many pop-ups in the lower right side of your monitor. I don't mean good advice like 'this file is safe etc'. I mean stuff about do you want to buy a product to stop tracking cookies? Adverts and more than one type. Sometimes you'll get three over short period of time, and be swearing at having to close irritating ad pop-ups. Like what the hell is Norton doing contacting me on my PC desktop experience?","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024"
"9","Norton 360 Deluxe 2024, Antivirus software for 5 Devices and 1-year subscription with automatic renewal, Includes Secure VPN and Password Manager, PC/Mac/iOS/Android, Activation Code by email","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","meandher","I’ve used Norton for several years as it seems an ok product. HOWEVER, Norton as a company continues to engage in some of the most egregious business practices to catch out those who are less tech savvy, so they are potentially, and unwittingly, hit with the full £90 (at time of writing) annual renewal fee or cajoled into paying for additional add-ons.The pros:In my time using Norton my pc has never, as far as I’m aware, caught a virus.It is easy to open and run a scan.The cons:Where to begin (!). As many reviews state you should always deactivate the auto renewal and buy a new license key at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately Norton make activating a new key this way as labyrinthine as possible. The online help will tell you to go to a settings page in your current installation of Norton and put in the new key. However, if you have disabled auto renew this method will show an error code that will force you to log in to the main website. Here, to activate your new key Norton will insist that you enter your credit card details and enable auto renew before you then can (& have) to download a new install of the app (that you already have installed on your pc) before it will activate. This also means you will lose any remaining time on your current Norton install as it doesn’t link the subscriptions.The autorenewal - Since I last installed this Norton appear to have changed the fine print so that if you have deactivated the annual auto-renewal  you also lose access to a number of features including the much vaunted “Virus Protection Promise” I.e. if your pc does get a virus…you have no recourse to Norton unless you’ve pre-agreed to let them charge you £90 next year, in advance. This makes no sense if you think about it. If you’re thinking all you’ll do is set a reminder to cancel the auto-renewal a couple of weeks or a month before the renewal date, Norton have also changed the fine print to state that they will take the next payment 35 days in advance (note that time period, as it’s before you start getting pop-up reminders ).The pop-ups/add-ons - once installed you will be hit with constant pop ups trying to upsell additional features and add-ins. Or pseudo-“critical’ notifications in red : “YOU HAVE X BROKEN REGISTRY ENTRIES- FIX NOW?” That, if clicked will take you to a page asking you to confirm the purchase of said add-on…. And they already have your credit card details from the setup process so, again, I can see how those less technically inclined can have unwitting added £20+ on to their annual subscription without even realising. You can turn these pop ups off but in reality they just seem to ‘snooze’ eventually coming back after a few days.In summary, yes, the core product seems to work well enough but the fact I have to put so much active effort in to avoiding being ripped off, or inadvertently charged additional costs makes me question Norton’s ethics and integrity as a company. Ultimately this will be the last time I  use them as there are alternatives out there, and it’s at the point now where it’s easier to go with a different product each year than trying to navigate Nortons renewal process.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023"

I was worried that maybe there is a catch but so far everything is good. I’ve installed it with no problem and it works perfectly. As other users have said: they do ask for bank/PayPal details so that they can automatically renew next year but they ask you for that when you buy directly from Norton and I just switch off renewal 35 days before expiry. You can also switch it off as soon as you installed the product but I keep mine for as long as I can because of a Virus Removal Service that only applies if you are enrolled into automatic renewal.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024"

The subscription may maybe too expensive after the first year (around £80).  The UI is very clean. The user experience is overall positive.I don't like the internal self-promotion popups (e.g. Automatic driver installations). It shows for instance your outdated drivers then would offer you a two-month trial period where you would have to enter your card details again (+£40 subscription). Just add the feature to the bundle. It gives a feeling of an in-app purchase feature or that the antivirus is incomplete.Norton is a great antivirus. They managed to clean the bad rep they had a long time ago. I feel this antivirus is superior to the others I tried (BitDefender, Avast, AV, Windows Defender, Panda...), however quite costly.On a security level, it is maybe on the same level as Kaspersky when it was safe to use.It is better than BitDefender for me because it didn't break Nodejs or Powershell.I removed one star for the subscription cost.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2024"

After trying various other brands, this for me is by far the simplest to use... Not too many interruptions like some do... Prompts etc... Just install and away you go.  Always remember to uninstall any existing virus software to save midday stopping advising you to do Just that.Although I have used this for years, this is the first time of buying via Amazon and after comparing prices elsewhere, the prices are very much the same (other then directly from company which is way much higher!).  If the pricing stays competitive, I will certainly buy next time.The software itself is do easy to install... From buying to installing it is a matter of a few clicks on the computer... No waiting around for the post to arrive or an email with an attachment etc... Straightforward from the off.I have never had any issues with viruses etc whilst using McAfee and use my computer worry free.Definitely recommend and a great, but realistic price point too!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 June 2023"

What is not explained, (and I am thankful to another reviewer for the hint) is that, is that it will not work on an iPad unless you use the Chrome browser. Most things default to safari so you need to be clear about how you do it!The other thing which is also not mentioned in any instructions is the app on iPad is not ""Total Protection"" - it offers ""Mcafee Security: VPN & Privacy"".  But after you (finally ......!) complete the install and 'sync account', you will see it counts as one of your 10 licenses against ""Total Protection"".The other thing I noted is that the VPN product, while worth having if you spend lots of time in coffee shops on strange wifi, is limited to 500mb while using the VPN so it's really a trial - and that is not advertised, Amazon need to grip that.  500mb is not going to last very long at all.The protection it gives is really good, but I feel the issues I mention above need addressing by both McAfee and Amazon and thus why it lost a star","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 October 2023"

As such I trusted their anti-virus protection and have kept it ever since. It's something I often regret as it's horribly flawed.  Not least their bullying attempt to get you to turn on auto-renew. [Never do that!]  They will rip you off.  Instead I learnt to buy my yearly subscription from Amazon for a fraction of the price [Good work Amazon!]. It requires jumping through many hoops, but the savings make it worthwhile as it's only once a year.  That said, whilst the protection they offer feels reassuring it's negated by the total harassment of the pop up notifications that can't be turned off, no matter what.  Most annoying - for me - is the pop up that constantly appears 3 months [3 MONTHS!] before your subscription lapses. It attempts to scare you into submission and force you down the more expensive path. It strikes me as a dreadful business model; but having worked for them doesn't surprise.  The senior management in my time were complete clenching sphincters, full of male toxicity. It appears nothing has changed on that front.  The only reason I continue with this poor service is the free VPN, which is occasionally useful.  Choose McAfee - if like me - you are prepared to fight crappy systems.  They still remain better than Norton in every sector [those guys are just rubbish].  I hope on many levels someone that counts reads this review as it's my true and honest testimony.  I'd also add that Windows Defender is very good and you probably don't need extra protection, but I'm a 'Belt and Braces' kinda guy.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2024"

Of course nobody wants so simple that adjustments can't be made but things like just trying to find the function you're looking for is not that clear.Part of the package, the VPN had a mind of its own and didn't always want to connect...even though my internet connect was fast and reliable!  I so wanted to utilise the VPN but it just kept dropping out for no reason (that I knew of) that I just had to turn it off - not helpful!To be honest, I installed the security system and have put my faith in its reliability - with scans, no threats have ever been found and whilst I'm on the net it stops installers, pop-ups etc etc, and warns me of dangerous websites.Would I buy this again? I always try to find value for money but over the ages having tried Bulldog, Norton, Kaspersky and now using McAfee - yes I would buy this again...if it was the best value for money.  One thing I don't like about any of the big named security providers is that they want to have ""auto renewal"" turned on when you first install the system; McAfee however, does not force you into this - you have the option if you want to turn this or or not.Overall score would've been better if the UI was improved.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2024"

They justify it by saying it stops the product expiring and your devices not being protected, fair enough but it also has the effect that if you forget to check the renewal price and let it auto renew, it could be much higher than your first year price. Instead of getting a prompt to renew and then reminding you to shop around for a deal.I left Norton this year as on their annual license listed on amazon it said they needed your card details and you would have to set up a subscription, so moved to mcafee as no mention of this in the description at the time, only to find out subscription required the same as Norton, so I felt a bit misled by that.After unsubscribing from auto renewal, the antivirus/security downloads and functions in the background as you would expect.

Absolutely no problems updating the subscription and as long as these deals continue I will re-purchase every year.

Having been stung by McAfee's expensive automatic renewal process in the past I had turned off the auto renew function so I could do it manually.If I had renewed directly through McAfee, they wanted US$169 as their default was to upgrade to something I didn't need. I could have switched to a lower package for US$69 or bought the full Total Protection package download direct from McAfee for £69.I opted instead to get the very same Total Protection 2019 download from Amazon for just under £21 which covers up to 10 devices (other options are available for 1, 3 or 5 devices). This is the exact same product that I was already using which simplifies the process. (It automatically updates to the latest version so I started 2 years ago with the 2017 version which has updated a few times). It's a digital download and Amazon sent an activation code by e-mail within 2 minutes.I was half expecting to have to remove and re-download the software on all my devices as payback for being too tight to pay the auto renewal fee but thankfully that was not the case. I just followed the instructions to activate the code using my existing McAfee account and it immediately updated the subscription across all registered devices. Really quick and simple.They tell you it can take a day or two for the new expiry date to appear on all devices but you can refresh it manually, which I did, and it all worked perfectly.One thing to remember though is when you renew the subscription, it re-sets the renewal option to automatic for next time and McAfee process the auto renewal a month or two early just to catch you out. If you want to avoid that happening you need to go into settings to switch off the auto renewal function every time you renew. There's no way you can forget about it because you get reminders popping up every day from about 2 months before renewal date.Yes McAfee have some questionable business practices but the product works and keeps my devices secure.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2024"

Complete installation from scratch last year was trouble-free and I've been impressed by the software over the last 12 months, so that, and the Amazon price this time, made renewal a no-brainer. The renewal process was remarkably straightforward. The Amazon email arrived immediately with the renewal code, and I followed the email instructions to go to the McAfee activate page. When I put in the renewal code and my email address, McAfee detected that I already had an account / licences with them, asked me to sign in (which I did) and then asked my to confirm that I wanted to apply the renewal to the 2019 Total Protection (rather than an older McAfee product on a now defunct computer). When I confirmed this, McAfee extended the TP licence expiry to the 2021 anniversary of the 2019 version, so I'll have the 2020 version for about 10 days more than the straight 365. And because I was just renewing TP, there was no need to remove old licences / versions and install TP from scratch. The whole process from signing into Amazon to buy through to signing out of McAfee and starting my first 2020 AV scan (just as a precaution) took less than 10 minutes. I'm very impressed. The AV software runs fine, the Amazon price is amazing, and I'm very happy to recommend both companies.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2019"

The probelm that everyone complains about. That you need to input your card details or you cannot activate the product. There are no words of that kind of behaviour.2. About the system to claim on the Norton guarantee of a refund if they cannot remove a virus. You have to be subscribed to automatic renewal. If you put your card details in to activate Norton, which initiates automatic renewal, then cancel automatic renewal. You can't use the guarantee.3. The app is flaky. When you move your mouse over any of the Norton windows that are open, your mouse lags. It makes using the app, unpleasant.4. If you have your PC on for a few hours the VPN on/off button stops working, forcing you to reboot to gain control.5. I was pleased about the back up data allowance. I figured I might want to back up the odd picture/document. Only to be extremely disappointed. When I went to look at this feature, it required being set-up. At the start of this process, it asked if I wanted to back up all my pictures on my PC. Declining means not being able to use the back-up system.6. Installing add on security features like Norton Safe Search is not user friendly. If you add 'safe-search' it affects something I use often. E.g. you are on a webpage and see a line of text you want to google. You can left-click and drag across it, then right click on it. Then there is an option to search google for that highlighted text. With Safe-Search enabled, Norton takes that over and displays Norton results and not Google results. I.e. changing your search engine. I have had to revert back to copying text I want to search on, and paste it into google.This is a far as I got. I gave up installing add-ons of any kind, because I could not be bothered with the hassle. Very likely I would not have liked how other features operate. There are a few features I am not even trying to use. To a certain extent I gave up exploring other general options too.The VPN is handy if you want to view region restricted content. However using a VPN on a regular basis is somewhat a pain. Wesites load noticabely slower. Some websites are blocked to VPNs, because VPN anonimity is what hackers use. Amazon Priome Video is 50/50 whether it will let you stream with the VPN on. If yu use the VPN day-today, you may have to turn it off to use Amazon Prime Video. ...

HOWEVER, Norton as a company continues to engage in some of the most egregious business practices to catch out those who are less tech savvy, so they are potentially, and unwittingly, hit with the full £90 (at time of writing) annual renewal fee or cajoled into paying for additional add-ons.The pros:In my time using Norton my pc has never, as far as I’m aware, caught a virus.It is easy to open and run a scan.The cons:Where to begin (!). As many reviews state you should always deactivate the auto renewal and buy a new license key at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately Norton make activating a new key this way as labyrinthine as possible. The online help will tell you to go to a settings page in your current installation of Norton and put in the new key. However, if you have disabled auto renew this method will show an error code that will force you to log in to the main website. Here, to activate your new key Norton will insist that you enter your credit card details and enable auto renew before you then can (& have) to download a new install of the app (that you already have installed on your pc) before it will activate. This also means you will lose any remaining time on your current Norton install as it doesn’t link the subscriptions.The autorenewal - Since I last installed this Norton appear to have changed the fine print so that if you have deactivated the annual auto-renewal  you also lose access to a number of features including the much vaunted “Virus Protection Promise” I.e. if your pc does get a virus…you have no recourse to Norton unless you’ve pre-agreed to let them charge you £90 next year, in advance. This makes no sense if you think about it. If you’re thinking all you’ll do is set a reminder to cancel the auto-renewal a couple of weeks or a month before the renewal date, Norton have also changed the fine print to state that they will take the next payment 35 days in advance (note that time period, as it’s before you start getting pop-up reminders ).The pop-ups/add-ons - once installed you will be hit with constant pop ups trying to upsell additional features and add-ins. Or pseudo-“critical’ notifications in red : “YOU HAVE X BROKEN REGISTRY ENTRIES- FIX NOW?” That, if clicked will take you to a page asking you to confirm the purchase of said add-on…. And they already have your credit card details from the setup process so, again, I can see how those less technically inclined can have unwitting added £20+ on to their annual subscription without even realising. You can turn these pop ups off but in reality they just seem to ‘snooze’ eventually coming back after a few days.In summary, yes, the core product seems to work well enough but the fact I have to put so much active effort in to avoiding being ripped off, or inadvertently charged additional costs makes me question Norton’s ethics and integrity as a company. Ultimately this will be the last time I  use them as there are alternatives out there, and it’s at the point now where it’s easier to go with a different product each year than trying to navigate Nortons renewal process.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023"

When you move your mouse over any of the Norton windows that are open, your mouse lags. It makes using the app, unpleasant.4. If you have your PC on for a few hours the VPN on/off button stops working, forcing you to reboot to gain control.5. I was pleased about the back up data allowance. I figured I might want to back up the odd picture/document. Only to be extremely disappointed. When I went to look at this feature, it required being set-up. At the start of this process, it asked if I wanted to back up all my pictures on my PC. Declining means not being able to use the back-up system.6. Installing add on security features like Norton Safe Search is not user friendly. If you add 'safe-search' it affects something I use often. E.g. you are on a webpage and see a line of text you want to google. You can left-click and drag across it, then right click on it. Then there is an option to search google for that highlighted text. With Safe-Search enabled, Norton takes that over and displays Norton results and not Google results. I.e. changing your search engine. I have had to revert back to copying text I want to search on, and paste it into google.This is a far as I got. I gave up installing add-ons of any kind, because I could not be bothered with the hassle. Very likely I would not have liked how other features operate. There are a few features I am not even trying to use. To a certain extent I gave up exploring other general options too.The VPN is handy if you want to view region restricted content. However using a VPN on a regular basis is somewhat a pain. Wesites load noticabely slower. Some websites are blocked to VPNs, because VPN anonimity is what hackers use. Amazon Priome Video is 50/50 whether it will let you stream with the VPN on. If yu use the VPN day-today, you may have to turn it off to use Amazon Prime Video. ... Whereas other brand/manufacturer VPNs are fine.There are far too many pop-ups in the lower right side of your monitor. I don't mean good advice like 'this file is safe etc'. I mean stuff about do you want to buy a product to stop tracking cookies? Adverts and more than one type. Sometimes you'll get three over short period of time, and be swearing at having to close irritating ad pop-ups.

HOWEVER, Norton as a company continues to engage in some of the most egregious business practices to catch out those who are less tech savvy, so they are potentially, and unwittingly, hit with the full £90 (at time of writing) annual renewal fee or cajoled into paying for additional add-ons.The pros:In my time using Norton my pc has never, as far as I’m aware, caught a virus.It is easy to open and run a scan.The cons:Where to begin (!). As many reviews state you should always deactivate the auto renewal and buy a new license key at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately Norton make activating a new key this way as labyrinthine as possible. The online help will tell you to go to a settings page in your current installation of Norton and put in the new key. However, if you have disabled auto renew this method will show an error code that will force you to log in to the main website. Here, to activate your new key Norton will insist that you enter your credit card details and enable auto renew before you then can (& have) to download a new install of the app (that you already have installed on your pc) before it will activate. This also means you will lose any remaining time on your current Norton install as it doesn’t link the subscriptions.The autorenewal - Since I last installed this Norton appear to have changed the fine print so that if you have deactivated the annual auto-renewal  you also lose access to a number of features including the much vaunted “Virus Protection Promise” I.e. if your pc does get a virus…you have no recourse to Norton unless you’ve pre-agreed to let them charge you £90 next year, in advance. This makes no sense if you think about it. If you’re thinking all you’ll do is set a reminder to cancel the auto-renewal a couple of weeks or a month before the renewal date, Norton have also changed the fine print to state that they will take the next payment 35 days in advance (note that time period, as it’s before you start getting pop-up reminders ).The pop-ups/add-ons - once installed you will be hit with constant pop ups trying to upsell additional features and add-ins. Or pseudo-“critical’ notifications in red : “YOU HAVE X BROKEN REGISTRY ENTRIES- FIX NOW?” That, if clicked will take you to a page asking you to confirm the purchase of said add-on…. And they already have your credit card details from the setup process so, again, I can see how those less technically inclined can have unwitting added £20+ on to their annual subscription without even realising. You can turn these pop ups off but in reality they just seem to ‘snooze’ eventually coming back after a few days.In summary, yes, the core product seems to work well enough but the fact I have to put so much active effort in to avoiding being ripped off, or inadvertently charged additional costs makes me question Norton’s ethics and integrity as a company. Ultimately this will be the last time I  use them as there are alternatives out there, and it’s at the point now where it’s easier to go with a different product each year than trying to navigate Nortons renewal process.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023"

The operator was doing something with my windows (think trying to update it) but then the laptop done an automatic restart (we were disconnected).I got in touch with the operator again and informed them that we had been disconnected due to my laptop restart.

After trying various other brands, this for me is by far the simplest to use... Not too many interruptions like some do... Prompts etc... Just install and away you go.  Always remember to uninstall any existing virus software to save midday stopping advising you to do Just that.Although I have used this for years, this is the first time of buying via Amazon and after comparing prices elsewhere, the prices are very much the same (other then directly from company which is way much higher!).  If the pricing stays competitive, I will certainly buy next time.The software itself is do easy to install... From buying to installing it is a matter of a few clicks on the computer... No waiting around for the post to arrive or an email with an attachment etc... Straightforward from the off.I have never had any issues with viruses etc whilst using McAfee and use my computer worry free.Definitely recommend and a great, but realistic price point too!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 June 2023"

Easy to navigate the menu.

You can manually switch it off in the browser settings, but doing it every time you use VPN ( and I use it frequently) is a pain in the neck.

Lawrence","I have used Bitdefender for many years with its low impact on my system hardware speed but a high level of protection. If you switch on all of the protection, it even protects against ransomware which has been very high profile in the news lately. The installation process is painless and this version can protect 10 devices that include smartphones and tablets.  Amazon is cheaper than buying from Bitdefender directly, something their sales desk admits.  All of the PC test reviews I have looked at agree that its detection rates and more importantly what it does when it finds something, is the best of the best and it has saved me from problems many times when surfing the net. Sometimes this is because website designers have not been too careful about how they have assembled their sites. A well-known UK supermarket always flashes up warnings genuinely but I am protected against those bad elements in real-time by Bitdefender so I can still get my order done in safely. This is one purchase you will not regret.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2023"

I had a paid version of Kaspersky prior to bitdefender and that wasn't as annoying.  Bitdefender continually sends notifications asking me to turn on the VPN, I get that they want to make more money but I already have surfshark so I ain't interested and I cannot find a way to switch them off.  Secondly the other day I get a notification telling me my phone was at risk, I go into bitdefender to run a scan after seeing another message saying we are aware of malware on your device.  So I run a scan after which I get the message your device was clean no malware found, but why don't you switch on our VPN... It's a bit like a cheap Chinese knock-off program, fairly regularly I get notifications about the VPN thing or some other stuff to try to get me to pay for paid add ons to the software.Another annoying thing is that I am being asked to turn on scam alert so I pressed the button to turn it on and I'm informed that I need to authorise something in settings.  There's a button which I need to click on and that supposedly will take me to the area in settings where I need to be be, I do this and I am brought back to the original page which is telling me that scam alert needs to be turned on.  This seems to be a never-ending circle as it never gets me into settings.  I report it and they want screenshot after screenshot after screenshot... That's a whole story in itself!I want a security program to run in the background to not be intrusive unless there is a definite attack on my phone or my PC and to be able to switch certain areas on or off without going round and round in circles.I don't want it popping up all the time like a delboy salesman try to sell me something that I don't need or want.

I had a paid version of Kaspersky prior to bitdefender and that wasn't as annoying.  Bitdefender continually sends notifications asking me to turn on the VPN, I get that they want to make more money but I already have surfshark so I ain't interested and I cannot find a way to switch them off.  Secondly the other day I get a notification telling me my phone was at risk, I go into bitdefender to run a scan after seeing another message saying we are aware of malware on your device.  So I run a scan after which I get the message your device was clean no malware found, but why don't you switch on our VPN... It's a bit like a cheap Chinese knock-off program, fairly regularly I get notifications about the VPN thing or some other stuff to try to get me to pay for paid add ons to the software.Another annoying thing is that I am being asked to turn on scam alert so I pressed the button to turn it on and I'm informed that I need to authorise something in settings.  There's a button which I need to click on and that supposedly will take me to the area in settings where I need to be be, I do this and I am brought back to the original page which is telling me that scam alert needs to be turned on.  This seems to be a never-ending circle as it never gets me into settings.  I report it and they want screenshot after screenshot after screenshot... That's a whole story in itself!I want a security program to run in the background to not be intrusive unless there is a definite attack on my phone or my PC and to be able to switch certain areas on or off without going round and round in circles.I don't want it popping up all the time like a delboy salesman try to sell me something that I don't need or want.

Unfortunately Norton make activating a new key this way as labyrinthine as possible. The online help will tell you to go to a settings page in your current installation of Norton and put in the new key. However, if you have disabled auto renew this method will show an error code that will force you to log in to the main website. Here, to activate your new key Norton will insist that you enter your credit card details and enable auto renew before you then can (& have) to download a new install of the app (that you already have installed on your pc) before it will activate. This also means you will lose any remaining time on your current Norton install as it doesn’t link the subscriptions.The autorenewal - Since I last installed this Norton appear to have changed the fine print so that if you have deactivated the annual auto-renewal  you also lose access to a number of features including the much vaunted “Virus Protection Promise” I.e. if your pc does get a virus…you have no recourse to Norton unless you’ve pre-agreed to let them charge you £90 next year, in advance.

HOWEVER, Norton as a company continues to engage in some of the most egregious business practices to catch out those who are less tech savvy, so they are potentially, and unwittingly, hit with the full £90 (at time of writing) annual renewal fee or cajoled into paying for additional add-ons.The pros:In my time using Norton my pc has never, as far as I’m aware, caught a virus.It is easy to open and run a scan.The cons:Where to begin (!). As many reviews state you should always deactivate the auto renewal and buy a new license key at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately Norton make activating a new key this way as labyrinthine as possible. The online help will tell you to go to a settings page in your current installation of Norton and put in the new key. However, if you have disabled auto renew this method will show an error code that will force you to log in to the main website. Here, to activate your new key Norton will insist that you enter your credit card details and enable auto renew before you then can (& have) to download a new install of the app (that you already have installed on your pc) before it will activate. This also means you will lose any remaining time on your current Norton install as it doesn’t link the subscriptions.The autorenewal - Since I last installed this Norton appear to have changed the fine print so that if you have deactivated the annual auto-renewal  you also lose access to a number of features including the much vaunted “Virus Protection Promise” I.e. if your pc does get a virus…you have no recourse to Norton unless you’ve pre-agreed to let them charge you £90 next year, in advance. This makes no sense if you think about it. If you’re thinking all you’ll do is set a reminder to cancel the auto-renewal a couple of weeks or a month before the renewal date, Norton have also changed the fine print to state that they will take the next payment 35 days in advance (note that time period, as it’s before you start getting pop-up reminders ).The pop-ups/add-ons - once installed you will be hit with constant pop ups trying to upsell additional features and add-ins. Or pseudo-“critical’ notifications in red : “YOU HAVE X BROKEN REGISTRY ENTRIES- FIX NOW?” That, if clicked will take you to a page asking you to confirm the purchase of said add-on…. And they already have your credit card details from the setup process so, again, I can see how those less technically inclined can have unwitting added £20+ on to their annual subscription without even realising. You can turn these pop ups off but in reality they just seem to ‘snooze’ eventually coming back after a few days.In summary, yes, the core product seems to work well enough but the fact I have to put so much active effort in to avoiding being ripped off, or inadvertently charged additional costs makes me question Norton’s ethics and integrity as a company. Ultimately this will be the last time I  use them as there are alternatives out there, and it’s at the point now where it’s easier to go with a different product each year than trying to navigate Nortons renewal process.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023"

However using a VPN on a regular basis is somewhat a pain. Wesites load noticabely slower. Some websites are blocked to VPNs, because VPN anonimity is what hackers use. Amazon Priome Video is 50/50 whether it will let you stream with the VPN on. If yu use the VPN day-today, you may have to turn it off to use Amazon Prime Video. ... Whereas other brand/manufacturer VPNs are fine.There are far too many pop-ups in the lower right side of your monitor. I don't mean good advice like 'this file is safe etc'. I mean stuff about do you want to buy a product to stop tracking cookies? Adverts and more than one type. Sometimes you'll get three over short period of time, and be swearing at having to close irritating ad pop-ups. Like what the hell is Norton doing contacting me on my PC desktop experience?","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2024"
"449","Norton 360 Premium + Utilities 2024 - Antivirus & Utility | 10 Devices | 1-year subscription | Automatic renewal, Secure VPN , Password Manager | 1 Device | PC/Mac/Mobile | Activation Code by email","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","meandher","I’ve used Norton for several years as it seems an ok product. HOWEVER, Norton as a company continues to engage in some of the most egregious business practices to catch out those who are less tech savvy, so they are potentially, and unwittingly, hit with the full £90 (at time of writing) annual renewal fee or cajoled into paying for additional add-ons.The pros:In my time using Norton my pc has never, as far as I’m aware, caught a virus.It is easy to open and run a scan.The cons:Where to begin (!). As many reviews state you should always deactivate the auto renewal and buy a new license key at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately Norton make activating a new key this way as labyrinthine as possible. The online help will tell you to go to a settings page in your current installation of Norton and put in the new key. However, if you have disabled auto renew this method will show an error code that will force you to log in to the main website. Here, to activate your new key Norton will insist that you enter your credit card details and enable auto renew before you then can (& have) to download a new install of the app (that you already have installed on your pc) before it will activate. This also means you will lose any remaining time on your current Norton install as it doesn’t link the subscriptions.The autorenewal - Since I last installed this Norton appear to have changed the fine print so that if you have deactivated the annual auto-renewal  you also lose access to a number of features including the much vaunted “Virus Protection Promise” I.e. if your pc does get a virus…you have no recourse to Norton unless you’ve pre-agreed to let them charge you £90 next year, in advance. This makes no sense if you think about it. If you’re thinking all you’ll do is set a reminder to cancel the auto-renewal a couple of weeks or a month before the renewal date, Norton have also changed the fine print to state that they will take the next payment 35 days in advance (note that time period, as it’s before you start getting pop-up reminders ).The pop-ups/add-ons - once installed you will be hit with constant pop ups trying to upsell additional features and add-ins. Or pseudo-“critical’ notifications in red : “YOU HAVE X BROKEN REGISTRY ENTRIES- FIX NOW?” That, if clicked will take you to a page asking you to confirm the purchase of said add-on…. And they already have your credit card details from the setup process so, again, I can see how those less technically inclined can have unwitting added £20+ on to their annual subscription without even realising. You can turn these pop ups off but in reality they just seem to ‘snooze’ eventually coming back after a few days.In summary, yes, the core product seems to work well enough but the fact I have to put so much active effort in to avoiding being ripped off, or inadvertently charged additional costs makes me question Norton’s ethics and integrity as a company. Ultimately this will be the last time I  use them as there are alternatives out there, and it’s at the point now where it’s easier to go with a different product each year than trying to navigate Nortons renewal process.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023"

In all my years (16 years +) of using, building and installing pc's into businesses, have I ever come across such a ""fish in a barrel"" scenario, where once they have your pc within their control.....there's a pop up most days offering essential additions to protect your important data. Hey user if you want VPN THEN PAY, ADDITIONAL PROTECTION, PAY. WE WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR SYSTEM, PAY. If you have watched Goodfellas, you get the pattern. We as a consumer will always seek a change for the better, and I fell for it.

Here’s my take:Aroma - A Whiff of the Sea:Right off the bat, the aroma is intriguing. It's got this maritime quality to it, like a fresh sea breeze mixed with a hint of smoky peat. Definitely sets the scene for what's to come.Taste - Peat with a Sweet Twist:The first sip hits you with that classic Talisker peat, but it's not overwhelming. There's a sweet undercurrent – think caramel and ripe fruits – that balances the smokiness beautifully. It’s smooth with a slight spicy kick at the end.Finish - Lingering and Warm:The finish is where this whisky really shines. It leaves a warm, smoky taste that lingers pleasantly, inviting you back for another sip.Packaging - Classy and Understated:The bottle is pretty sleek, with a label that’s straightforward and classy. Looks good on the shelf and gives off a vibe of quality.Price - Good Value for the Experience:For the quality of whisky you’re getting, the price feels about right. It's not the cheapest single malt out there, but it’s reasonably priced for what it offers.Overall - A Must-Try for Whisky Fans:If you’re into your single malts and haven’t tried Talisker Skye yet, it’s definitely worth a go. It’s a great example of what the Isle of Skye has to offer – a whisky with character, warmth, and a little bit of island magic.So, pour yourself a dram, sit back, and enjoy the ride!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2024"

Here’s my take:Aroma - A Whiff of the Sea:Right off the bat, the aroma is intriguing. It's got this maritime quality to it, like a fresh sea breeze mixed with a hint of smoky peat. Definitely sets the scene for what's to come.Taste - Peat with a Sweet Twist:The first sip hits you with that classic Talisker peat, but it's not overwhelming. There's a sweet undercurrent – think caramel and ripe fruits – that balances the smokiness beautifully. It’s smooth with a slight spicy kick at the end.Finish - Lingering and Warm:The finish is where this whisky really shines. It leaves a warm, smoky taste that lingers pleasantly, inviting you back for another sip.Packaging - Classy and Understated:The bottle is pretty sleek, with a label that’s straightforward and classy. Looks good on the shelf and gives off a vibe of quality.Price - Good Value for the Experience:For the quality of whisky you’re getting, the price feels about right. It's not the cheapest single malt out there, but it’s reasonably priced for what it offers.Overall - A Must-Try for Whisky Fans:If you’re into your single malts and haven’t tried Talisker Skye yet, it’s definitely worth a go. It’s a great example of what the Isle of Skye has to offer – a whisky with character, warmth, and a little bit of island magic.So, pour yourself a dram, sit back, and enjoy the ride!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2024"

"793","Three Barrels Rare Old French Brandy VSOP, 70cl","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","Kaspersky total security is my favourite of the all in one security packages and this is my 4th year using it. Always uninstall and buy digitally from amazon - it’s about 1/3 the price of renewing.Not much has changed this year - same great product with a slightly (very slightly) updated user interface. New this year so far seems to be an improved software updater that’s a nice touch.Reason I use this is that It regularly scores highest on malware tests, and as a bonus comes with actually useful tools like webcam blocker, the update checker, privacy and security optimisation browser plug-ins and such, and is very light on system resources - I don’t need to turn it off to game for example. I’ve bought a couple of computers that have come with trials of norton or trend micro and the just feel sub par by comparison.Minus 1 star from a perfect 5 for continuing to bundle kaspersky’s overpriced VPN software trial, and dumb region locking. The VPN can be removed post install by searching ‘add or remove programs’, but the region locking seemed particularly lazy.I didn’t notice when I bought this that it was UK only - that’s my bad, it says right on the page - but kaspersky’s enforcement is very lazy. I’m currently in Australia, but bought from the UK as my kaspersky account and payment card are still UK-based. It let me activate that serial fine (so no refund possibility) but then wouldn’t activate the software once downloaded even though the last one worked fine until the day before lol. They know my account, my history, my hardware, etc. it should work better. However all good as activated fine when using a VPN and no problems since with the VPN turned off.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2024"

"905","Woodford Reserve Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","CjW & KjW","I'm a Scotch lover with a particular penchant for the Islay offerings, so bourbon is a fairly new world to me. That said, I'd like to hope my palate is developed enough that I can pick up on a good amount of the tasting notes in a whisky.Woodford Reserve has such a stunning reputation and seems to be regarded as one of the top bourbons, especially at this price point. If I'm being brutally honest, I really don't see what all the fuss is about! It's not an unpleasant drink by any means, it's just entirely uninspiring. My first foray into bourbon was Buffalo Trace which I loved and it showed me just how much better American whisky can be than the typical Jack Daniels No. 7 (which I find absolutely disgusting). After that I tried Bulleit which was incredible too. Such a shame that I've heard Woodford touted above these two so many times and it ended up being such a let down.Nose: Vanilla, vanilla and more vanilla. I honestly get barely anything else except maybe the tiniest hint of banana.Palate: There's that vanilla again but this time a little toffee creeps in along with the classic oak bed bourbons are so often built on. There's a faint bit of chocolate and that banana from the nose again as well as something not unlike tobacco. Again incredibly faint and a little flat. It's very smooth but there is quite the burn leading into the finish. A couple of drops of water might well help but the other  flavours are so faint I'm afraid they'll end up lost entirely.Finish: This is where I have to give credit. The finish is completely butterscotch and very, very long. It takes me back to my childhood when my grandmother would share her Werther's Originals with me and that is what this finish is full of. It's just a shame the lead up to it was so average and there was such a bite on the end of a smooth palate that I had to get over before reaching it.All in all? An okay bourbon but in my personal opinion one that doesn't warrant half the praise it receives. Maybe I need to try more bourbons and go back to it with more experience. This is a 3 star whisky in nose and taste to me but the finish was so long and provoked such an emotive response from me that I had to add a star.

"935","Woodford Reserve Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","CjW & KjW","I'm a Scotch lover with a particular penchant for the Islay offerings, so bourbon is a fairly new world to me. That said, I'd like to hope my palate is developed enough that I can pick up on a good amount of the tasting notes in a whisky.Woodford Reserve has such a stunning reputation and seems to be regarded as one of the top bourbons, especially at this price point. If I'm being brutally honest, I really don't see what all the fuss is about! It's not an unpleasant drink by any means, it's just entirely uninspiring. My first foray into bourbon was Buffalo Trace which I loved and it showed me just how much better American whisky can be than the typical Jack Daniels No. 7 (which I find absolutely disgusting). After that I tried Bulleit which was incredible too. Such a shame that I've heard Woodford touted above these two so many times and it ended up being such a let down.Nose: Vanilla, vanilla and more vanilla. I honestly get barely anything else except maybe the tiniest hint of banana.Palate: There's that vanilla again but this time a little toffee creeps in along with the classic oak bed bourbons are so often built on. There's a faint bit of chocolate and that banana from the nose again as well as something not unlike tobacco. Again incredibly faint and a little flat. It's very smooth but there is quite the burn leading into the finish. A couple of drops of water might well help but the other  flavours are so faint I'm afraid they'll end up lost entirely.Finish: This is where I have to give credit. The finish is completely butterscotch and very, very long. It takes me back to my childhood when my grandmother would share her Werther's Originals with me and that is what this finish is full of. It's just a shame the lead up to it was so average and there was such a bite on the end of a smooth palate that I had to get over before reaching it.All in all? An okay bourbon but in my personal opinion one that doesn't warrant half the praise it receives. Maybe I need to try more bourbons and go back to it with more experience. This is a 3 star whisky in nose and taste to me but the finish was so long and provoked such an emotive response from me that I had to add a star. That said, I'd skip this one and give Bulleit a try instead.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2023"

"1004","Andrex Gentle Clean Toilet Rolls - 45 Toilet Roll Pack - Bulk Buy Toilet Rolls - Gentle and Soft on Your Family's Skin - Dermatologically Tested","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","PaTi","I've always used Andrex, as for me they have always been the best when you weigh up the price and performance you get for that price.

I didn't want the Gentle Clean, ""puppies on a roll"", type I wanted the traditional.  The first time was recently, with a supermarket purchase.  Andrex are producing so many different types of toilet roll but they are all good value.I have tried some of the other types, including the aloe vera ones for when I have visitors of the feminine kind.Even though I purchased the wrong type again, I do not mind as this puppies on a roll Andrex is good quality, soft and absorbant.  The reason I do prefer the traditional one is because the traditional one is also a good all rounder and can be used as kitchen roll, cleaning windows etc.  Anything tissue paper does, the traditional one is good at.This pack of 45 rolls is good value for money as even when Andrex is on offer in the supermarkets one can't find 45 rolls for this price.Now for the bit where some buyers are complaining that these are not real Andrex, they are fake, they are shorter, smaller than the ones they normally buy etc.  Sorry to say but they are wrong.  These rolls have not changed in size or thickness.  This is the standard size for the Gentle Clean (puppies on a roll) paper.  The ones I actually wanted, before making the same error again, are the traditional ones and they do have more paper on them and the sheets are larger but for this type of Andrex it is the correct size.  The paper is actually softer than the traditional paper and that is where the smaller size comes into play.  This is more costly to produce.  People claiming it is fake or Andrex have downsized etc. can just as easily buy much more newspaper for the same price but they certainly will not get the softness with it.  These are the genuine Andrex Gentle Clean rolls and they have not been downsized.I am highly recommending this 45 pack of Andrex Gentle Clean (puppies on a roll) as it is much better quality than the traditional one, it is much softer and so it is highly suitable for the bathroom / WC.  It's just not quite as good for some other uses such as cleaning windows as the fibres come loose and stick to the window.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2024"

I didn't want the Gentle Clean, ""puppies on a roll"", type I wanted the traditional.  The first time was recently, with a supermarket purchase.  Andrex are producing so many different types of toilet roll but they are all good value.I have tried some of the other types, including the aloe vera ones for when I have visitors of the feminine kind.Even though I purchased the wrong type again, I do not mind as this puppies on a roll Andrex is good quality, soft and absorbant.  The reason I do prefer the traditional one is because the traditional one is also a good all rounder and can be used as kitchen roll, cleaning windows etc.  Anything tissue paper does, the traditional one is good at.This pack of 45 rolls is good value for money as even when Andrex is on offer in the supermarkets one can't find 45 rolls for this price.Now for the bit where some buyers are complaining that these are not real Andrex, they are fake, they are shorter, smaller than the ones they normally buy etc.  Sorry to say but they are wrong.  These rolls have not changed in size or thickness.  This is the standard size for the Gentle Clean (puppies on a roll) paper.  The ones I actually wanted, before making the same error again, are the traditional ones and they do have more paper on them and the sheets are larger but for this type of Andrex it is the correct size.  The paper is actually softer than the traditional paper and that is where the smaller size comes into play.  This is more costly to produce.  People claiming it is fake or Andrex have downsized etc. can just as easily buy much more newspaper for the same price but they certainly will not get the softness with it.  These are the genuine Andrex Gentle Clean rolls and they have not been downsized.I am highly recommending this 45 pack of Andrex Gentle Clean (puppies on a roll) as it is much better quality than the traditional one, it is much softer and so it is highly suitable for the bathroom / WC.  It's just not quite as good for some other uses such as cleaning windows as the fibres come loose and stick to the window.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2024"

However, unfortunately the company used Hermes to deliver.  My local (Evri) agent will not ring the front door bell but instead insists on going past the front door and bell, round the side of the house and leaving packages, whatever the weather, round there for me to discover, sometimes days later.  This time, I found the package but it's too heavy for me to carry to my door so I'll have to wait for someone to come who can carry it for me.

"1055","Catsan Hygiene Cat Litter 20L","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","M. Burrows","I recently tried out the Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter, upon a friend's recommendation. As someone who has been using regular Catsan litter for quite some time, I was excited to give this new product a whirl. However, after using it for a while now, I have mixed feelings about its performance.Firstly, let me start by highlighting the positives. The Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter does an excellent job in terms of odor control and clumping ability. It effectively keeps any unpleasant smells at bay, leaving my home smelling fresh and clean. The clumps formed are tight and easy to scoop up, making the cleaning process hassle-free. This aspect alone earns it a decent rating of 4.However, when considering the price difference between the Catsan Smart Pack and their regular litter, I must admit that I am slightly disappointed. While I had hoped that the Smart Pack would last longer due to its unique design and packaging, I found that it didn't live up to my expectations in terms of longevity. Considering the higher price tag, I expected it to be more cost-effective in the long run. Sadly, this was not the case.Another drawback worth mentioning is that these smart packs do not fit all types of cat litter trays. If you have a standard rectangular tray with no raised sides or unusual shapes, then you're good to go. However, if your tray deviates from this norm in any way, you may encounter difficulties fitting the Smart Pack correctly.Overall, while there are certainly positive aspects to highlight about the Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter such as its superior odor control and clumping ability, I personally feel that it falls short when considering its value for money compared to regular Catsan litter. Additionally, the limited compatibility with certain cat litter trays can be quite inconvenient.So, despite giving it a rating of 4 out of 5 due to its positive attributes mentioned earlier, I have decided that I won't be purchasing the Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter again in the future.

As someone who has been using regular Catsan litter for quite some time, I was excited to give this new product a whirl. However, after using it for a while now, I have mixed feelings about its performance.Firstly, let me start by highlighting the positives. The Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter does an excellent job in terms of odor control and clumping ability. It effectively keeps any unpleasant smells at bay, leaving my home smelling fresh and clean. The clumps formed are tight and easy to scoop up, making the cleaning process hassle-free. This aspect alone earns it a decent rating of 4.However, when considering the price difference between the Catsan Smart Pack and their regular litter, I must admit that I am slightly disappointed. While I had hoped that the Smart Pack would last longer due to its unique design and packaging, I found that it didn't live up to my expectations in terms of longevity. Considering the higher price tag, I expected it to be more cost-effective in the long run. Sadly, this was not the case.Another drawback worth mentioning is that these smart packs do not fit all types of cat litter trays. If you have a standard rectangular tray with no raised sides or unusual shapes, then you're good to go. However, if your tray deviates from this norm in any way, you may encounter difficulties fitting the Smart Pack correctly.Overall, while there are certainly positive aspects to highlight about the Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter such as its superior odor control and clumping ability, I personally feel that it falls short when considering its value for money compared to regular Catsan litter. Additionally, the limited compatibility with certain cat litter trays can be quite inconvenient.So, despite giving it a rating of 4 out of 5 due to its positive attributes mentioned earlier, I have decided that I won't be purchasing the Catsan Smart Pack Cat Litter again in the future. Instead, I will stick to the regular Catsan litter that has served me well and offers better value for my money in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2024"

I also used it on our bathroom sealant round the bath which I had previously scrubbed over and over, and again it worked wonders. It didnt 100% remove all the black stains on the sealant and tiles, but it got 95% of it. It looks souch better. Brilliant stuff.

After a couple of hours I went to check and was amazed to find everything gleaming white, not a single speck of mould and no scrubbing involved!!!

Wherever possible I spray the area generously and leave overnight. Very deep/dark/large areas may require a second or even third application.It does have a strong chemical odour similar to strong bleach and care must be taken to protect from breathing in, spraying near eyes - especially ceilings, etc but taking common sense precautions is all that’s required e.g mask, goggles (a must if spraying at higher levels) and always ventilate the room by opening a window.I work in property management and attend many properties with condensation mould (20+ per year). This has been fantastic for dealing with mould issues quickly and easily.We also use this routinely for cleaning bathrooms (grout, sealant & ceilings) between tenancies as it saves so much time and expense as opposed to scrubbing grout with bleach and a toothbrush or worse still to remove and reapply sealant around baths, showers, basins, etc.In my own home I used to have the sealant replaced in the shower every 12-18 months. Since using this, it looks like new and keeps fresh for several years. Keeping on top of mould spots and spraying as they arise prevents the requirement for multiple applications, results are speedy and it makes one bottle last forever!I’ve only dropped one star as the product takes several hours to do its magic so further application(s) (and property visits in the case of work) might be required. The odour is significant when working with large areas of mould…but, I’m just being strict in case people are highly sensitive to the strong chemical odour or expect one squirt to perform miracles within seconds. The safety catch above the trigger is a bit fiddly but an essential safety feature for child-safety and accidents. The internal tube now needs inserting prior to first use, which again is fiddly, but a good feature to prevent the tube being damaged by the chemical if it’s left to sit in the bottle for a long time before use - as has happened in the past.These are just my own personal experiences and opinions. Hope it helps!If there was an option I’d rate it 4.5/5","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024"

Every year we dread autumn through to spring, but this year we found this spray and it has been a game changer.We have mainly used it on walls, grout and windows and this little bottle has cut out hours of scrubbing and lots of stress and worry. I don’t like the idea use of using chemicals but it really worries me about the health effects the damp has on my family and this £5 product has made a significant impact on our lengthy battle with trying to keep it away.

Whilst it does say to leave it 30 minutes, I was cooking at the time so left it longer. After a couple of hours I went to check and was amazed to find everything gleaming white, not a single speck of mould and no scrubbing involved!!!

Wherever possible I spray the area generously and leave overnight. Very deep/dark/large areas may require a second or even third application.It does have a strong chemical odour similar to strong bleach and care must be taken to protect from breathing in, spraying near eyes - especially ceilings, etc but taking common sense precautions is all that’s required e.g mask, goggles (a must if spraying at higher levels) and always ventilate the room by opening a window.I work in property management and attend many properties with condensation mould (20+ per year). This has been fantastic for dealing with mould issues quickly and easily.We also use this routinely for cleaning bathrooms (grout, sealant & ceilings) between tenancies as it saves so much time and expense as opposed to scrubbing grout with bleach and a toothbrush or worse still to remove and reapply sealant around baths, showers, basins, etc.In my own home I used to have the sealant replaced in the shower every 12-18 months. Since using this, it looks like new and keeps fresh for several years. Keeping on top of mould spots and spraying as they arise prevents the requirement for multiple applications, results are speedy and it makes one bottle last forever!I’ve only dropped one star as the product takes several hours to do its magic so further application(s) (and property visits in the case of work) might be required. The odour is significant when working with large areas of mould…but, I’m just being strict in case people are highly sensitive to the strong chemical odour or expect one squirt to perform miracles within seconds. The safety catch above the trigger is a bit fiddly but an essential safety feature for child-safety and accidents. The internal tube now needs inserting prior to first use, which again is fiddly, but a good feature to prevent the tube being damaged by the chemical if it’s left to sit in the bottle for a long time before use - as has happened in the past.These are just my own personal experiences and opinions.

I was having to clean the mould in the shower with bleach and a toothbrush almost every week and couldn't reach the mould on the ceiling. It was getting to the point that I was embarrassed to have guests over!Ordered this and sprayed the whole shower and ceiling above the shower and left it. Whilst it does say to leave it 30 minutes, I was cooking at the time so left it longer. After a couple of hours I went to check and was amazed to find everything gleaming white, not a single speck of mould and no scrubbing involved!!! I rinsed it all with water (apart from the ceiling obviously) and whilst there is a strong smell of bleach in the bathroom, it's better than no smell and mould!So glad I bought this!! Wish I'd taken pictures now!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"
"1194","HG Mould Spray, Effective Mould Spray & Mildew Cleaner, Removes Mouldy Stains From Walls, Tiles, Silicone Seals & More - 500ml","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","Having tried many, many mould sprays this is the only one that is really highly effective.I’ve used the spray on silicone sealant that I expected would require expensive replacement as dark black mould spots were present, but just a couple of applications and the mould disappeared altogether.Very deep, dark & large areas of mould which has penetrated throughout the sealant may not disappear or several applications, but will fade significantly.In addition to bathroom & kitchen sealant, I use it on discoloured grout, backs of furniture (with care not to soak, having tested an area first & not expensive/varnished items), window frames & seals, skirting boards, and bathroom/shower walls & ceilings (I don’t think it’s recommended for painted surfaces, but as no scrubbing is required it’s been absolutely fine on white emulsion-painted areas in my experience). Wherever possible I spray the area generously and leave overnight. Very deep/dark/large areas may require a second or even third application.It does have a strong chemical odour similar to strong bleach and care must be taken to protect from breathing in, spraying near eyes - especially ceilings, etc but taking common sense precautions is all that’s required e.g mask, goggles (a must if spraying at higher levels) and always ventilate the room by opening a window.I work in property management and attend many properties with condensation mould (20+ per year). This has been fantastic for dealing with mould issues quickly and easily.We also use this routinely for cleaning bathrooms (grout, sealant & ceilings) between tenancies as it saves so much time and expense as opposed to scrubbing grout with bleach and a toothbrush or worse still to remove and reapply sealant around baths, showers, basins, etc.In my own home I used to have the sealant replaced in the shower every 12-18 months. Since using this, it looks like new and keeps fresh for several years. Keeping on top of mould spots and spraying as they arise prevents the requirement for multiple applications, results are speedy and it makes one bottle last forever!I’ve only dropped one star as the product takes several hours to do its magic so further application(s) (and property visits in the case of work) might be required. The odour is significant when working with large areas of mould…but, I’m just being strict in case people are highly sensitive to the strong chemical odour or expect one squirt to perform miracles within seconds. The safety catch above the trigger is a bit fiddly but an essential safety feature for child-safety and accidents. The internal tube now needs inserting prior to first use, which again is fiddly, but a good feature to prevent the tube being damaged by the chemical if it’s left to sit in the bottle for a long time before use - as has happened in the past.These are just my own personal experiences and opinions. Hope it helps!If there was an option I’d rate it 4.5/5","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024"

In the past, we have tried different mixtures from vinegar, bleach, other mould sprays plus have used a dehumidifier along with £1 damp boxes in nooks and crannies alas we have a constant battle with the black stuff! Every year we dread autumn through to spring, but this year we found this spray and it has been a game changer.We have mainly used it on walls, grout and windows and this little bottle has cut out hours of scrubbing and lots of stress and worry. I don’t like the idea use of using chemicals but it really worries me about the health effects the damp has on my family and this £5 product has made a significant impact on our lengthy battle with trying to keep it away.

I have NEVER seen anything see off mould as fast, ever! We live in an apartment, south facing, which is great in summer, but in the winter all the doors are battened down and vents closed to keep the heat in as the wind hits us straight off the Pennines. Result? Mould around the edges of the windows due to condensation. This product removed it in seconds! Rather than spray directly onto the mould, I sprayed a little on a damp cloth which was going straight in the bin afterwards. Wiped it over the mould, did the same again a few seconds later and.....GONE!!! Wiped it down with a clean wet cloth, then a dry one.It smells a bit, so keep the windows open!Would I recommend it?

As a parent, one of my top priorities is ensuring the well-being of my little one, and that includes choosing products that are safe, gentle, and environmentally friendly. WaterWipes Original Plastic Free Baby Wipes have become an essential part of my daily baby care routine, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. Here's why these wipes deserve a five-star review:1.Pure and Gentle: WaterWipes are specifically designed with babies in mind. They contain only two ingredients – 99.9% purified water and a drop of fruit extract. This minimalistic approach ensures that my baby's sensitive skin is pampered without exposure to harsh chemicals, fragrances, or irritants.2.Ultimate Convenience: With a pack of 360 wipes in each bundle, these wipes are perfect for busy parents. I never have to worry about running out of wipes at inconvenient times. Plus, the wipes are conveniently sized, making them easy to use one-handed.3.Superior Quality: The wipes themselves are strong, durable, and have a smooth texture that effectively cleans without causing any abrasions. They are moist enough to get the job done but not overly wet, which I appreciate.4.Eco-Friendly Choice: One of the standout features of WaterWipes is their commitment to sustainability. These wipes are plastic-free, and the packaging is recyclable. It's reassuring to know that I'm not contributing to environmental pollution while caring for my baby.5.Versatile Use: These wipes are not just for diaper changes. I've found them handy for various tasks, from wiping messy hands and faces to cleaning up spills and even refreshing on-the-go. Their versatility makes them a practical choice for any parent.6.Hypoallergenic: WaterWipes are dermatologist-approved and hypoallergenic. This is a huge relief for parents of babies with sensitive skin or allergies, as it reduces the risk of irritation or rashes.7.No Nasty Residue: After using WaterWipes, I've noticed there's no sticky residue left behind on my baby's skin, which can sometimes happen with other wipes. Their pure and gentle nature ensures my baby stays clean and comfortable.In summary, WaterWipes Original Plastic Free Baby Wipes have exceeded my expectations in every way. They provide the utmost care for my baby's skin while also aligning with my values of environmental responsibility. With a generous count in each pack, they're a practical and cost-effective choice.

I like the fact they don't sting. If you've ever wondered why your baby girl cry's when you use baby wipes to clean their bits..it's coz most wipes sting like heck! They don't have perfume in or alcohol they are water. And now these wipes don't have plastic in them..they are better for the planet. Most wipes do still have plastic in them and if you dig those up in 50yrs time they will still be recognisable as baby wipes.

They don't have perfume in or alcohol they are water. And now these wipes don't have plastic in them..they are better for the planet. Most wipes do still have plastic in them and if you dig those up in 50yrs time they will still be recognisable as baby wipes.

These wipes don't leave your skin feeling sticky when you're skin is cleaned. So BIG bonus. Only problem I have is that the wipes don't come out of the packet easy. If the big brand most used(in UK anyway) can make each wipe follow on from the last when pulled out. Why can't you, or a lot of other makes for that matter. I have to fiddle around trying to find the end of the next wipe without either ripping the wipe or pulling a lot of them out at once coz i need them quickly and then trying to stuff the ones not used back in the packet or wiping surfaces with them just to use them but then I run out of wipes for the purpose I need them.

So far I've only found two brands that do not trigger my pompholyx eczema too badly, Waterwipes and Cheeky Panda. Many other brands that claim to be ""99% water"" still have chemicals in, and in me that means the itching within seconds and itchy blisters start forming.Performance- they aren't as thick as some other brands, and it seems they used to be a little thicker as well, but they're still thick enough to be effective and hold onto water and be used firmly, and it also makes it easier to clean fiddly bits like ears so it isn't a big loss that they're a little thinner. As they don't have many added ingredients, it means you can still use them with any cleanser or lotion of your choice and irritants aren't sealed in close to the skin by lotion. As mentioned earlier, I also use them for my dog with allergies as we have to wipe his face with something that hasn't been washed in detergents to remove any traces that might trigger his contact allergy. The wipes are strong enough to not tear or disintegrate when used on his whiskers, but at the same time they're soft so they don't damage his thin, fragile, soft whippety skin.I get that for some they smell a bit unappealing due to the lack of perfumes, but for many people those are the worst triggers for their allergies, and some people may want lotion in their baby wipes so to them it will seem like they're missing those ingredients, but this is what allergy sufferers need, products that are as pure as possible. Of course some people may still be sensitive to any of the ingredients in these wipes, but for my allergy needs Waterwipes are perfect and leave no residue to cause any other problems.Because of Waterwipes not having lotion or surfactants in, they are safe to be used near eyes and sensitive areas so can be used to take makeup off in conjunction with a suitable makeup remover, as well as facial cleansing.

"1301","Earth Rated Dog Poo Bags, Guaranteed Leak Proof and Extra Thick Waste Bag Refill Rolls For Dogs, Lavender Scented, 270 Count","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Amanda D","I have a giant of a 1 year old GSD, so you can imagine the size of his waste! These bags are large so there's plenty of much needed room inside and although I used to prefer bags with handles, these bags are just as easy to tie up and I actually prefer this type of bag now. I keep a roll with a small rubber band around them in mine. It saves space, my pockets are tidier and it's much easier to find a tissue in my coat pocket than it was with loose bags in them! If I'm out without a coat, I keep a half-roll in my 5th jeans pocket. They fit in there rather nicely!As well as being big (22 x 33 cm), these bags are strong! They don't tear easily and I've never poked a finger through these bags, very much unlike the more 'nappy bag' bags I used to use before! They are a big step up from those flimsy bags and although the cost is a little more I find I'm using less bags and I don't need to double bag them to stop or reduce smells escaping from bags in my garden dog bin either, even in the summer. They are definitely a more hygienic option. The dog bin used to smell bad in warm weather but these bags really do a good job of keeping the smell (therefore the bacteria) in the bag. I do sometimes get a whiff from the bags during hot sunny summer weather though.Does anyone wake up some mornings to find foxes have broken into your bin and strewn bags all over the garden? I do! I have a fox problem here, perhaps likely from a couple of my neighbours who keep chickens and ducks, but ""problem"" depends on your view on foxes, of course! For me, mine are garden pests but I like them otherwise. Point here is these bags have never split from being thrown around by foxes, although I'm sure they could get into them if they really wanted to. I'm still devising solutions to stop them getting into my bin!The rolls have 15 bags on each. The perforations are good and in line and this ensures they are easy to remove from the roll. I've not had even one bag wasted by tearing it when tearing one off the roll. I buy the 270 pack so they work out at around 4p each when buying the pack at full price (currently £10.99). For me, that's a cost of 84p per week.Note! They are certified 65% recycled plastic now and I'm keen to reduce my plastic waste so this is a big plus for me. I hope this company continues to be environmentally conscious because when companies provide more environmental products it helps consumers make better choices.Pros65% recycled plasticLarge and strongDo not tear easilyLeakproofEasy to tie upEasy to rip a bag off the rollSmells leak less in hot weather otherwise no noticeable smell at all.ConsMore expensive than other bags. Potentially, it's a bag we throw away, so how good do you need your poo bags to be?Costs - for my dog's use4p per bag at full price = costs me around 84p per week1 roll (of 15 bags) lasts approx 5 daysThe whole pack of 270 bags lasts 54 days or approx 2 months.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 May 2023"

These bags serve their purpose perfectly, making it easy and hygienic to clean up after my furry friend.One of the things I really like about these bags is their durability. They are thick and sturdy, so I never have to worry about any unpleasant surprises or leaks. They hold up well even with larger messes, providing a reliable solution for dog waste disposal.Another great feature is the size of the bags. They are large enough to accommodate waste from even the biggest dogs, ensuring I never run out of space. Plus, the easy-to-tear perforations make it convenient to grab a bag and go, saving time during those urgent moments.However, one aspect I wish could be improved is the scent control. While the bags do a decent job of containing the odor, there are times when it's still noticeable. It would be great if the bags had stronger scent-blocking capabilities to ensure complete freshness.All in all, Earth Rated Dog Poo Bags have been a trustworthy and practical choice for me as a dog owner in the UK. They are durable, spacious, and make clean-up a breeze. Although the scent control could be enhanced, it doesn't overshadow the overall effectiveness of these bags. I highly recommend them to fellow dog owners seeking a reliable companion on their walks.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2023"

Plenty long enough to be able to tie in a knot and they don’t let any smell out.I’ve carried mine around a park before (full) and not noticed any pong.I love that you get a little sticker when you have 2 bags left on the roll, nothing worse than running out!They are fantastic value for money, I purchase mine on subscription so never run out. I wouldn’t buy anything else now.Definitely the best on the market.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2024"

"1344","Earth Rated Dog Poo Bags, Guaranteed Leak Proof and Extra Thick Waste Bag Refill Rolls For Dogs, Lavender Scented, 270 Count","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Tracy Beattie","As a dog owner in the UK, I've been using Earth Rated Dog Poo Bags for quite some time now, and I must say they have become an essential part of our daily walks. These bags serve their purpose perfectly, making it easy and hygienic to clean up after my furry friend.One of the things I really like about these bags is their durability. They are thick and sturdy, so I never have to worry about any unpleasant surprises or leaks. They hold up well even with larger messes, providing a reliable solution for dog waste disposal.Another great feature is the size of the bags. They are large enough to accommodate waste from even the biggest dogs, ensuring I never run out of space. Plus, the easy-to-tear perforations make it convenient to grab a bag and go, saving time during those urgent moments.However, one aspect I wish could be improved is the scent control. While the bags do a decent job of containing the odor, there are times when it's still noticeable. It would be great if the bags had stronger scent-blocking capabilities to ensure complete freshness.All in all, Earth Rated Dog Poo Bags have been a trustworthy and practical choice for me as a dog owner in the UK. They are durable, spacious, and make clean-up a breeze. Although the scent control could be enhanced, it doesn't overshadow the overall effectiveness of these bags. I highly recommend them to fellow dog owners seeking a reliable companion on their walks.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2023"

They are very large and being on a roll save so much time just pulling one as needed instead of scrabbling to extricate one from a pocket full of thin loose black bags. There is no unpleasant smell to them; they are strong, leak proof and, by not closing them completely, will easily accommodate further ‘deposits’ even from a very large dog. (Tip:  if you find the weather turns on a walk unused bags do make amazing waterproof and windproof gauntlets!)","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2024"

Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover is amazing. It removes new and dried-in stains, even the ones that have been there for months. It works on all kinds of stains, such as coffee, wine, mud, chocolate, and more. It also eliminates odors and leaves a fresh scent.The product comes with a 650 ml bottle and an applicator brush. The bottle has a nozzle that allows you to spray the product directly on the stain. The applicator brush has stiff bristles that help to scrub the stain and lift it off the carpet fibers. The product is easy to use and doesn’t require any rinsing or vacuuming. You just spray, brush, and blot with a clean cloth. The stain disappears in minutes.The only thing I don’t like about this product is that it’s quite expensive. However, I think it’s worth it, because it saves me time and money in the long run. I don’t have to hire a professional carpet cleaner or replace my carpets. I can keep them looking new and clean with this product.Overall, this is a fantastic product for anyone who has carpets and pets or kids. It removes stains quickly and effectively, and it’s easy to use. It’s a miracle worker for stubborn carpet stains.

"1391","Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover | Removes New and Dried-in Stains | Includes Applicator Brush, 650 ml","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","primeuser101","I’ve tried many different products to remove stains, but none of them worked as well as this one. Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover is amazing. It removes new and dried-in stains, even the ones that have been there for months. It works on all kinds of stains, such as coffee, wine, mud, chocolate, and more. It also eliminates odors and leaves a fresh scent.The product comes with a 650 ml bottle and an applicator brush. The bottle has a nozzle that allows you to spray the product directly on the stain. The applicator brush has stiff bristles that help to scrub the stain and lift it off the carpet fibers. The product is easy to use and doesn’t require any rinsing or vacuuming. You just spray, brush, and blot with a clean cloth. The stain disappears in minutes.The only thing I don’t like about this product is that it’s quite expensive. However, I think it’s worth it, because it saves me time and money in the long run. I don’t have to hire a professional carpet cleaner or replace my carpets. I can keep them looking new and clean with this product.Overall, this is a fantastic product for anyone who has carpets and pets or kids. It removes stains quickly and effectively, and it’s easy to use. It’s a miracle worker for stubborn carpet stains. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a reliable carpet cleaner.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 December 2023"

Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover is amazing. It removes new and dried-in stains, even the ones that have been there for months. It works on all kinds of stains, such as coffee, wine, mud, chocolate, and more. It also eliminates odors and leaves a fresh scent.The product comes with a 650 ml bottle and an applicator brush. The bottle has a nozzle that allows you to spray the product directly on the stain. The applicator brush has stiff bristles that help to scrub the stain and lift it off the carpet fibers. The product is easy to use and doesn’t require any rinsing or vacuuming. You just spray, brush, and blot with a clean cloth. The stain disappears in minutes.The only thing I don’t like about this product is that it’s quite expensive. However, I think it’s worth it, because it saves me time and money in the long run. I don’t have to hire a professional carpet cleaner or replace my carpets. I can keep them looking new and clean with this product.Overall, this is a fantastic product for anyone who has carpets and pets or kids. It removes stains quickly and effectively, and it’s easy to use. It’s a miracle worker for stubborn carpet stains.

Dr. Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover is amazing. It removes new and dried-in stains, even the ones that have been there for months. It works on all kinds of stains, such as coffee, wine, mud, chocolate, and more. It also eliminates odors and leaves a fresh scent.The product comes with a 650 ml bottle and an applicator brush. The bottle has a nozzle that allows you to spray the product directly on the stain. The applicator brush has stiff bristles that help to scrub the stain and lift it off the carpet fibers. The product is easy to use and doesn’t require any rinsing or vacuuming. You just spray, brush, and blot with a clean cloth. The stain disappears in minutes.The only thing I don’t like about this product is that it’s quite expensive. However, I think it’s worth it, because it saves me time and money in the long run. I don’t have to hire a professional carpet cleaner or replace my carpets. I can keep them looking new and clean with this product.Overall, this is a fantastic product for anyone who has carpets and pets or kids. It removes stains quickly and effectively, and it’s easy to use. It’s a miracle worker for stubborn carpet stains. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a reliable carpet cleaner.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 December 2023"

The fire starter does produce a spark although it isn't as large or easy as the one shown in the video although maybe I just need more practice.I've seen a few comments referencing that the compass doesn't appear to work, which it does but there is a slight issue.The metal blade built into the clip which attaches to the compass section interferes with it and causes the north to constantly point towards the metal which makes the compass appear to be broken when in fact it is just being overridden by the metal of the blade.This means that when the clip is undone it is a perfectly operational piece of equipment that is able to quickly reposition itself as you move but as soon as you wear it the metal overrides it and the north becomes frozen.Excluding the compass issue this appears the be an outstanding piece of equipment which is very lightweight and portable, some parts are a little wonky but at this price for two items you can't complain.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2024"

The only dislike is that the draw string spring is a little loose. Other than that it works perfect. The flint was good, the strike was nice and sharp so you could easily scrap some wood the strike the flint for a fire. I mean it was €12 for two of them so if you are living in the wild you probably would buy something better but I hike regularly and have taken it on 5 hikes now and have used it to navigate each hike when my phone signal was down. Overall it is a good product and comfortable to wear.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"

It's a brilliant yet simple piece of survival kit you never know you'll need. ""Better to have something you don't need than to need it and not have it."" Are the words I live by.Every piece of this gear works as intended, the compass (when unclipped) actually works and points in the correct direction, my kids love grabbing my arm and blowing the whistle, so that's getting some use and driving the missy insane. I'm glad to know I can always start a fire if a survival situation should ever arrive with the flint scraper and rod. I find it very comfortable to wear and most often forget it's even there. Worth every penny, and best to be safe!The only issue I have, is the wrist toggle, while I appreciate that you can increase or decrease the size of the wrist length, the toggle is a bit weak and keeps losing up, but thats an easy fix for me.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2024"

"1793","Lifesystems Pocket First Aid Kit, CE Certified Contents, Specifically Designed for Hiking and Outdoor","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Outdoor Adventures","This is a reasonably well thought out first aid kit.Pros:Easy to carry size, with space to add your own gear in. I've added a small pill bottle (with pills containing ibuprofen, parcetamol, aspirin, anti indigestion, caffeine & antihistamine tablets), condoms, hangover sachets and waterproof plasters, with space for a couple of extra items if needed (may add an aluminium blanket & ear plugs)Cons:Would have been nice to have it waterproof, they've got the waterproof zip on it, surely it wouldn't take much of a change or cost to do so as it's such of a small item and Lifesystems do make large waterproof versions, it would be nice for them to extend this feature to the rest of their range.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 June 2020"

Very easy to use.Just ordered two more so I can keep one in the kitchen and one in my van.You can sharpen at work, in front of the telly, up a mountain, no messing with water or anything, you can use it anywhere without a bench.I've used it to great effect on Pen Knives, Pocket Knives, Kitchen Knives, Sushi Knives, Carving Knives, Hunting Knives, Cutlery Steel, Carbon Steel, Razor Steel, all no problem with excellent results.Few tips :It's not a Chef's Steel, don't try and use it like one.Here's the biggie NEVER USE IT WITH YOUR HAND IN FRONT OF THE BLADE. Sorry for shouting.Just flip the blade so the edge is away from you and hold the sharpener behind the blade.Pick your angle and sweep left and right like you're shading on a line with a pencil.Don't saw across the blade. Always run along the blade, left right, handle to tip. You don't need to do long full sweeps, just keep it even.Like this it's impossible to cut yourself or scratch the flat of the knife.As the edge apexes you'll start pushing a burr over the apex.Keep flipping sides and reducing pressure until the burr reduces to nothing.If you're not getting a good edge you are either not properly apexed yet or you're using too much pressure and knackering up the apex.The last sweeps should feel like warm butter with a feather pressure.Test the edge on a single sheet of paper, that'll show you where you need to do more work.Scrub deposits off the sharpener on cardboard or a roll of paper.If you want to polish or strop the edge afterwards use a leather belt for razor steel or leather with polishing compound on it for harder steels.Yes, you can do a faster better job with £300 worth of Japanese Whetstones, but come on, are you a Sushi Chef or do you just want your knives to work properly? 🤔😂Anyway, this is much easier to use on smaller blades and doesn't make a mess.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2024"

Very easy to use.Just ordered two more so I can keep one in the kitchen and one in my van.You can sharpen at work, in front of the telly, up a mountain, no messing with water or anything, you can use it anywhere without a bench.I've used it to great effect on Pen Knives, Pocket Knives, Kitchen Knives, Sushi Knives, Carving Knives, Hunting Knives, Cutlery Steel, Carbon Steel, Razor Steel, all no problem with excellent results.Few tips :It's not a Chef's Steel, don't try and use it like one.Here's the biggie NEVER USE IT WITH YOUR HAND IN FRONT OF THE BLADE. Sorry for shouting.Just flip the blade so the edge is away from you and hold the sharpener behind the blade.Pick your angle and sweep left and right like you're shading on a line with a pencil.Don't saw across the blade. Always run along the blade, left right, handle to tip. You don't need to do long full sweeps, just keep it even.Like this it's impossible to cut yourself or scratch the flat of the knife.As the edge apexes you'll start pushing a burr over the apex.Keep flipping sides and reducing pressure until the burr reduces to nothing.If you're not getting a good edge you are either not properly apexed yet or you're using too much pressure and knackering up the apex.The last sweeps should feel like warm butter with a feather pressure.Test the edge on a single sheet of paper, that'll show you where you need to do more work.Scrub deposits off the sharpener on cardboard or a roll of paper.If you want to polish or strop the edge afterwards use a leather belt for razor steel or leather with polishing compound on it for harder steels.Yes, you can do a faster better job with £300 worth of Japanese Whetstones, but come on, are you a Sushi Chef or do you just want your knives to work properly? 🤔😂Anyway, this is much easier to use on smaller blades and doesn't make a mess.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2024"

I got one in the end, sadly at the full £13 tag, as the offer price meant you had to prove your age for some reason, nope, not for this product so I had to wait.  It's super useful for a light touch up in the field. With the rounded edge you can get your mushroom knife or similar well edged, and the groove is useful for the back edge of the point or a fishing hook. It's a touch up sharpener not a honing one.  The dual end thing is ok but no needed.The Bad ...  the price is to high, they used to be well under £10 and offered at £10. The top that covers the little V shaped sharpener needs to fit better and with more of a detent so you can feel it's home, sadly it comes of if you're not careful. Attention to detail, something lacking in most things these days.If you're going to sell a product at an elevated price the quality should be reflected. In all the years I've been on amazon I seen maybe on or two 5star products and this is not one of them.  As for the rating features of a product, we don't need to, it just confuses people and increases the rating.It's good but not that good. Useful but not essential.

"2001","Throw Throw Burrito Card Game by Exploding Kittens - A Dodgeball Card Game - Fun Family Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids, 2-6 Players","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Starry night","This game is absolutely bonkers – and a lot of fun. It’s beautifully presented – the game comes in a nicely made, rigid storage box that should last well. If I’m being really critical, it is a bit overpackaged, although most of the internal packaging (barring cellulose wrapping around two decks of cards) is made from paper or card. The avocados are really cute: with friendly, smiling faces and slightly bugging eyes. There are decent elements of realism too: the avocado halves are pretty much the right size for a real avocado, and one half has the stone in it, whilst the other has a hole. The two would fit together neatly, were it not for their eyes! The avocados are designed to be thrown at other players: they’re made from coated foam and are soft, squishy, and completely safe. Far less sting-y than ball pit play balls can be!The game itself is total pandemonium, in which pretty much everything you know and expect from the structuring a board/card game… gets thrown out the window. Dealing is haphazard, as is game play. The rule booklet encourages you to watch a video instead of reading the rules. There are no clear turns. The game is designed to create a mess of cards dumped in other players’ draw pots, instead of neat, structured piles. It’s fast, furious, hilarious… and you get to repeatedly throw squishy toy avocados at people. Loved it!There’s a clever bit of marketing involved, too. The game is a sequel to ‘Throw Throw Burrito’, and includes an add-on extension game that can only be played in conjunction with the burrito game. The manufacturers make this hard to ignore: there’s a paper envelope of cards that you’re instructed NOT to open as it contains an expansion that can only be used in combination with ‘Throw, throw burritio’. I’m contrary enough to have followed the instructions here, and have not opened the envelope. At time of writing, we do not own ‘Throw, throw burrito’ – and unless one of our friends owns a set we can borrow, I think it’s safe to say that by Christmas we will have invested in the original game, because I think this will be a lot of fun if a family Christmas is back on the cards in 2021.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2021"

"2031","Throw Throw Burrito Card Game by Exploding Kittens - A Dodgeball Card Game - Fun Family Card Games for Adults, Teens & Kids, 2-6 Players","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase","Starry night","This game is absolutely bonkers – and a lot of fun. It’s beautifully presented – the game comes in a nicely made, rigid storage box that should last well. If I’m being really critical, it is a bit overpackaged, although most of the internal packaging (barring cellulose wrapping around two decks of cards) is made from paper or card. The avocados are really cute: with friendly, smiling faces and slightly bugging eyes. There are decent elements of realism too: the avocado halves are pretty much the right size for a real avocado, and one half has the stone in it, whilst the other has a hole. The two would fit together neatly, were it not for their eyes! The avocados are designed to be thrown at other players: they’re made from coated foam and are soft, squishy, and completely safe. Far less sting-y than ball pit play balls can be!The game itself is total pandemonium, in which pretty much everything you know and expect from the structuring a board/card game… gets thrown out the window. Dealing is haphazard, as is game play. The rule booklet encourages you to watch a video instead of reading the rules. There are no clear turns. The game is designed to create a mess of cards dumped in other players’ draw pots, instead of neat, structured piles. It’s fast, furious, hilarious… and you get to repeatedly throw squishy toy avocados at people. Loved it!There’s a clever bit of marketing involved, too. The game is a sequel to ‘Throw Throw Burrito’, and includes an add-on extension game that can only be played in conjunction with the burrito game. The manufacturers make this hard to ignore: there’s a paper envelope of cards that you’re instructed NOT to open as it contains an expansion that can only be used in combination with ‘Throw, throw burritio’. I’m contrary enough to have followed the instructions here, and have not opened the envelope. At time of writing, we do not own ‘Throw, throw burrito’ – and unless one of our friends owns a set we can borrow, I think it’s safe to say that by Christmas we will have invested in the original game, because I think this will be a lot of fun if a family Christmas is back on the cards in 2021.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2021"

I have done a quick video to show you what's in the box, and for me the comic booklet that comes with it is a very close second to the actual game and great in its own right!The idea of the game is to cover your eyes with one hand whilst trying to build blocks in sequential order with the other... well most of you are... there is an evil wombat who is trying to destroy all your towers! It is very easily as hard as it sounds... and then some! After you get to grips with the basic game there is other power card that can be incorporated into the game too. Ive done a quick video showing you what's actually in the box and I will try and get a quick vid of some game play the next time I find some players who are less camera shy... But all I can say is its great fun and I can see it being an essential family game as well as a brilliant ice breaker to take to university.

If you're a good wombat, you try to build the towers and get points at the end of the round if you've completed two or more. The bad wombats score points by ensuring that only one tower or less have been completed by the end of the round. You're team wins when you reach 3 points.How don't you know who is who?

It suggests being for 3-6 players. 2 people can't play the game together however more than 6 could play. It might just get a little chaotic.At the start of the game you're all assigned the role of either a good wombat or a bad wombat. If you're a good wombat, you try to build the towers and get points at the end of the round if you've completed two or more. The bad wombats score points by ensuring that only one tower or less have been completed by the end of the round. You're team wins when you reach 3 points.How don't you know who is who? The building and knocking down is done with your eyes closed or blindfolded!There's also a definite among us vibe involved in trying to find out who the imposter like Bad Wombats are.So a fun dexterity party game for multiple people with no real age limit required as anyone can understand the principal of being good or bad and can be shown the cards so even if they can't read, they know which role they are.It's not cheap for a board game, but equally its not expensive either and is pretty averagely priced.The components are plastic but seem sturdy enough to be up to the job and not likely to break.Happy to recommend.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2023"

The dark humor and witty prompts had us in stitches right from the beginning. We found ourselves engaged in a flurry of hilariously absurd scenarios and answering outrageous questions. The game brilliantly taps into our sense of humor and thrives on the unexpected, delivering non-stop laughter that can brighten up any gathering.Furthermore, the game's unique combination of strategy and humor kept us on our toes throughout.

It's not just about having a good laugh, but also about outsmarting your opponents and strategically navigating through the game's twists and turns.The quality of the game components is also worth mentioning. The cards are durably made and the illustrations are cleverly designed. The writing on the cards is hilarious and ensures that every draw is a surprise waiting to be unveiled. The game rules are easy to follow, allowing us to dive right into the fun without any confusion or delays.All in all, Ginger Fox's ""We're All Gonna Die"" party game is an absolute riot.

I stumbled upon the UNO All Wild Card Game, and let me tell you, my life took a turn more unexpected than a surprise party at an introvert's house!So, there I am, unboxing this deck of unlimited chaos. It's like opening Pandora's box, but instead of unleashing doom, I get 112 cards of pure unpredictability. I thought, ""Great, a family game night staple!"" Little did I know, it's more like a wild night in Vegas.The key feature? Every card is a wild card. I felt like a wizard holding a deck of magical mischief. No matching colors or numbers – it's like UNO took a walk on the wild side, and I'm the tour guide through chaos.Now, picture this: Date night. I thought, ""Let's spice things up with UNO All Wild."" Turns out, the game is more unpredictable than my dating history. The 'Wild Forced Swap' card? Let's just say it's not a recommended icebreaker.Family game night with parents was another adventure. The 'Wild Targeted Draw 2' card became a tool for settling old scores. Mom targeted Dad, Dad retaliated. Suddenly, I'm a referee in a domestic UNO dispute.Took it to work, thinking it's a team-building exercise. Boss loved the 'Wild Skip 2' card so much he skipped me right out of the company. Fired for playing UNO, but hey, worth it.Experimented with a child – easy, right? Wrong. Kids are tactical geniuses. The moment they learned about the 'Wild Draw 4,' they used it strategically. Now, I owe a 7-year-old five ice creams.And pets? Tried playing with a goldfish. Turns out, they're not great at holding cards. My living room turned into a fishy UNO battlefield. Let's just say, Operation Fish-Draw didn't go swimmingly.Bad feature alert: The 'Wild Swap Hands.' Used it with my cousin, and now I know more about his life choices than I ever wanted. Turns out, some secrets should stay in the deck.Quality of life upgrade? Absolutely. My social calendar is busier than ever. Why? Because UNO All Wild has made me the neighborhood UNO guru. People come for the game, stay for the hilarity.As for attractiveness to women, let's just say, nothing says charm like playing a 'Wild Reverse' card when she expects a compliment. Who knew UNO could be a love potion?In conclusion, UNO All Wild is not just a card game; it's a wild ride through unexpected scenarios. If your life needs a dash of chaos and a sprinkle of laughter, this deck is your golden ticket.Please appreciate this review with a chuckle and consider inviting UNO All Wild to your next game night.

It’s basically UNO with all wild cards, which means you can change the color or make someone draw cards at any time. The game also comes with erasable wild cards that you can customize with your own rules for added excitement. We had some hilarious moments with these cards, like making someone sing a song or do a dance.The game is easy to learn and play, and it’s suitable for ages 7 and up. It’s great for family nights, parties, or just passing the time. The cards are good quality and durable, and they come in a nice box that’s easy to store.The only downside I can think of is that the game can get chaotic and unpredictable, which might not be everyone’s cup of tea. Some people might prefer the original UNO with more structure and strategy. Also, some of the erasable wild cards were hard to write on or erase completely.Overall, I think this is a fun and creative variation of UNO that adds more spice and laughter to the game. If you’re looking for something different and exciting to play with your friends or family, I recommend giving this game a try.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 July 2023"

I stumbled upon the UNO All Wild Card Game, and let me tell you, my life took a turn more unexpected than a surprise party at an introvert's house!So, there I am, unboxing this deck of unlimited chaos. It's like opening Pandora's box, but instead of unleashing doom, I get 112 cards of pure unpredictability. I thought, ""Great, a family game night staple!"" Little did I know, it's more like a wild night in Vegas.The key feature? Every card is a wild card. I felt like a wizard holding a deck of magical mischief. No matching colors or numbers – it's like UNO took a walk on the wild side, and I'm the tour guide through chaos.Now, picture this: Date night. I thought, ""Let's spice things up with UNO All Wild."" Turns out, the game is more unpredictable than my dating history. The 'Wild Forced Swap' card? Let's just say it's not a recommended icebreaker.Family game night with parents was another adventure. The 'Wild Targeted Draw 2' card became a tool for settling old scores. Mom targeted Dad, Dad retaliated. Suddenly, I'm a referee in a domestic UNO dispute.Took it to work, thinking it's a team-building exercise. Boss loved the 'Wild Skip 2' card so much he skipped me right out of the company. Fired for playing UNO, but hey, worth it.Experimented with a child – easy, right? Wrong. Kids are tactical geniuses. The moment they learned about the 'Wild Draw 4,' they used it strategically. Now, I owe a 7-year-old five ice creams.And pets? Tried playing with a goldfish. Turns out, they're not great at holding cards. My living room turned into a fishy UNO battlefield. Let's just say, Operation Fish-Draw didn't go swimmingly.Bad feature alert: The 'Wild Swap Hands.' Used it with my cousin, and now I know more about his life choices than I ever wanted. Turns out, some secrets should stay in the deck.Quality of life upgrade? Absolutely. My social calendar is busier than ever. Why? Because UNO All Wild has made me the neighborhood UNO guru. People come for the game, stay for the hilarity.As for attractiveness to women, let's just say, nothing says charm like playing a 'Wild Reverse' card when she expects a compliment. Who knew UNO could be a love potion?In conclusion, UNO All Wild is not just a card game; it's a wild ride through unexpected scenarios. If your life needs a dash of chaos and a sprinkle of laughter, this deck is your golden ticket.Please appreciate this review with a chuckle and consider inviting UNO All Wild to your next game night.

It’s basically UNO with all wild cards, which means you can change the color or make someone draw cards at any time. The game also comes with erasable wild cards that you can customize with your own rules for added excitement. We had some hilarious moments with these cards, like making someone sing a song or do a dance.The game is easy to learn and play, and it’s suitable for ages 7 and up. It’s great for family nights, parties, or just passing the time. The cards are good quality and durable, and they come in a nice box that’s easy to store.The only downside I can think of is that the game can get chaotic and unpredictable, which might not be everyone’s cup of tea. Some people might prefer the original UNO with more structure and strategy. Also, some of the erasable wild cards were hard to write on or erase completely.Overall, I think this is a fun and creative variation of UNO that adds more spice and laughter to the game. If you’re looking for something different and exciting to play with your friends or family, I recommend giving this game a try.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 July 2023"

It's called UNO FLIP!, and trust me, it's a rollercoaster ride for your sanity.At first glance, you might think, ""Oh, it's just UNO with a little twist."" Well, my friends, it's more than a twist – it's like UNO went on a wild bender and woke up on the wrong side of the bed.So, here's how it goes. You start with a deck of cards that's already making you question your life choices. But wait, there's more! There's a special Flip card, and it's like the Pandora's Box of UNO. When that card hits the table, all hell breaks loose.Imagine this: You're just one card away from victory, you're feeling cocky, and then someone drops that dreaded Flip card. Suddenly, you're in an alternate UNO dimension where everything is upside down, and you're drowning in cards. It's like a card game version of Inception.Now, let's talk about the chaos that unfolds when you're playing with friends. UNO FLIP! takes your friendships and puts them in a blender. You'll see your closest pals turn into devious masterminds, plotting your downfall with every flip. I've seen lifelong friendships crumble over a game of UNO FLIP!, and let me tell you, it's worth every minute.But here's the best part – the crazy ideas on how to use this game. You can use the cards to build a house of cards and then dramatically flip the table, just like a movie villain. Or turn it into a high-stakes drinking game where every Flip card means a shot. Just don't blame me for the hangover.In conclusion, UNO FLIP! is not just a card game; it's a test of your patience, your friendships, and your ability to embrace chaos. It's like the Game of Thrones of card games – expect betrayal, unexpected twists, and a lot of shouting.

It's called UNO FLIP!, and trust me, it's a rollercoaster ride for your sanity.At first glance, you might think, ""Oh, it's just UNO with a little twist."" Well, my friends, it's more than a twist – it's like UNO went on a wild bender and woke up on the wrong side of the bed.So, here's how it goes. You start with a deck of cards that's already making you question your life choices. But wait, there's more! There's a special Flip card, and it's like the Pandora's Box of UNO. When that card hits the table, all hell breaks loose.Imagine this: You're just one card away from victory, you're feeling cocky, and then someone drops that dreaded Flip card. Suddenly, you're in an alternate UNO dimension where everything is upside down, and you're drowning in cards. It's like a card game version of Inception.Now, let's talk about the chaos that unfolds when you're playing with friends. UNO FLIP! takes your friendships and puts them in a blender. You'll see your closest pals turn into devious masterminds, plotting your downfall with every flip. I've seen lifelong friendships crumble over a game of UNO FLIP!, and let me tell you, it's worth every minute.But here's the best part – the crazy ideas on how to use this game. You can use the cards to build a house of cards and then dramatically flip the table, just like a movie villain. Or turn it into a high-stakes drinking game where every Flip card means a shot. Just don't blame me for the hangover.In conclusion, UNO FLIP! is not just a card game; it's a test of your patience, your friendships, and your ability to embrace chaos. It's like the Game of Thrones of card games – expect betrayal, unexpected twists, and a lot of shouting. So, if you're ready for the most intense UNO experience of your life, grab a deck, and may the flips be ever in your favor! 🃏🙃🍻","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2024"

My 10 year old loves the song so I got this for him for a Christmas present. We are serious board gamers and he's used to playing games with more complex rules (worker placement, engine builders etc) but I thought that this would be a nice short easy to play game. It's pretty fun as we've already played it 3 times in one sitting. It is a 'take that' game with player elimination, so for me it was more fun with just 2 players. However it's not as mean as Munchkin and the lenticular cards are darkly humorous as you kill off the beans. My son loves the cartoon illustrations and it's great to pick up and play for a few minutes to get your kid off devices. The photo shows the least gruesome 'you died' card I could find but it's cartoon humour with 'beans' instead of people so we like it. We'll be keeping and playing this one as our non-gamer friends will find the rules easy and the illustrations are great. Also it plays up to 5 people so will work for a larger group. The lenticular cards do warp over time but apparently that's not unusual and doesn't affect gameplay.

My 10 year old loves the song so I got this for him for a Christmas present. We are serious board gamers and he's used to playing games with more complex rules (worker placement, engine builders etc) but I thought that this would be a nice short easy to play game. It's pretty fun as we've already played it 3 times in one sitting. It is a 'take that' game with player elimination, so for me it was more fun with just 2 players. However it's not as mean as Munchkin and the lenticular cards are darkly humorous as you kill off the beans. My son loves the cartoon illustrations and it's great to pick up and play for a few minutes to get your kid off devices. The photo shows the least gruesome 'you died' card I could find but it's cartoon humour with 'beans' instead of people so we like it. We'll be keeping and playing this one as our non-gamer friends will find the rules easy and the illustrations are great. Also it plays up to 5 people so will work for a larger group. The lenticular cards do warp over time but apparently that's not unusual and doesn't affect gameplay. The quality is lovely with linen finish on the playing cards, a custom die amd moulded insert which was a nice surprise.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2023"
