"3","Movie","12th Fail","movie_goer82","12th Fail is a bold movie and movies like this must be made more frequently.Alas, nowadays making such movies isn't possible easily because masses are more inclined to watch poorly made but highly promoted movies like Kashmir Files or Kerala story.This will surely inspire many and will give morale boost to many aspirants and will give it's viewer to think after watch.Direction is superb and acting of Vikrant Messy is top notch.All Hail Vikrant Massey & Vidhu Vinod Chopra As They Shape The Most Pure, Personal & Brave Hindi Film In A Long Time.12th Fail deserves an audience, and we, as cinephiles, deserve cinema that respects us. Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Vikrant Massey have served one.","27 October 2023","9/10"
"4","Movie","12th Fail","rohit-81569","Vikrant Massey what an amazing performance. After Irfan Khan it is the first time I have seen such a real acting on screen. Keep doing such films.Simple story-telling, no bollywood masala and reality at its peak. Vidhu Vinod Chopra has done justice with the script. This is the difference between experienced director and know it all ""directors"". Yes, I am talking about TVF guys. 2 seasons and they literally have made a mockery of IAS struggle. They should watch this and learn from the best.I just hope now that Vikrant gets a best actor award for this. He deserves it.That ""restart"" song is gonna stay in my mind for long. And yeah huge round of applause at the end in the theatre. Go and watch it, please!","28 October 2023","10/10"
"5","Movie","12th Fail","saviotr","First of all it is important to thank Vidhu Vinod Chopra for making this film. The story has been told in such a heartwarming way that the audience is totally involved in this inspiring story of grit, determination and victory against all odds. The performances are award worthy. Vikram Massey is outstanding in the lead role and is well supported by the rest of the cast. The direction, screenplay and editing are top notch. Unfortunately in India the over the top and illogical films become blockbusters and the really outstanding films don't do well commercially. I hope the Indian audience views such films as it will encourage film makers to do top quality work of international standards. This film falls in category that the Hindi film industry should feel proud of.","29 October 2023","10/10"
"6","Movie","12th Fail","priyankarocksghoshal","Vikrant Massey- what an actor! He is one of the most talented actors of the industry and I feel it's high time that people realize that.His expressions and dialogue delivery make this movie a masterpiece.This story of a young guy who is innocent, naive, simple touches your heart like nothing else.Vidhu Vinod Chopra has created a movie that will be relevant forever!Manoj's victory and defeats feel beyond personal! When he cracks the UPSC interview and starts crying, you feel so proud of him, and makes you so emotional!Nobody could do Manoj the way Vikrant did! He is the magic and he is an inspiration, not because he cracks the exam but because he is such a great person!Al hearts!","30 October 2023","10/10"
"7","Movie","12th Fail","puranjanbasak","12th fail is a bigraphical drama film directed by vidhu vinod chopra.I cannot explain to you what level of performance i have seen from vikrant massey. Its national award worthy. His every expression, dialogue delivery, mannerism, everything was pitch perfect. When he broke down in the final scene out of happiness, a piece of heart smiled. This actor deserves all the accolades. Another actor to applaud is medha shankar. First of all, I could not take my eyes off her, she is that pretty. And her peforamance was prettier. Her dialogue delivery and expression is on point. Anshuman pushkar plays the sandeep bhaiya, sad at his peers' misery and joyous at their success. I guess we all deserve a shraddha and gauri bhaiya in our lives, if we ever have the courage to go through what manoj kumar sir had to.The writing is brilliant, and nothing else. The characters it sets up is outstanding. We feel for them, smile and laugh at their success, break down when they break down, thats the example of finest writing. The screenplay is engaging, despite taking care of very minute details. The editing of the film is sharp, the way it captures the mindspace of manoj's first impression of mukherjeenagar is brilliant. The cinematography is brilliant, hand held shots, long shots, the use of real locations gives us the authentic feel that yes, the characters are real, the world is real, the struggle is real.The social commentary on our education system and its flaws is criticised severely. Every person has a different struggle, you have to fight through it. This is a very special film, if you feel, watch it in theatres, it deserves more love.","4 November 2023","10/10"

"11","Movie","12th Fail","Kornephoros","Superlative acting by each person in the movie, even those playing much smaller roles. The fact that it is based on a true story makes you really understand and appreciate what the person went through and how he achieved it. Dadi is awesome 😎Vikrant Massey plays the character with such ease. Do read how he prepared for the movie. It reminds me of Aamir Khan. Medha Shankar, Anshumaan Pushkar, Anant Joshi have portrayed their roles beautifully.The storyline flows effortlessly from the beginning and the narration by Anant is superb. What you also live through is the hard work that people put in while preparing for the UPSC exams, especially those coming from far flung villages of the country.A movie that you would definitely want the kids in the family to see. Congratulations to the entire cast and crew. You have delivered a masterpiece !","31 October 2023","10/10"
"12","Movie","12th Fail","vinaygupta-03300","Wow! This is one of the rare movies that actually made me cry. Tears were rolling down my cheek by the end of the movie and head was heavy with dizziness. Keeping philosophy of the movie aside, as far the cinema is concerned, it was an absolute brilliant. I would say that not only Vikrant Massey but all of the actors did phenomenal work. The innocence of Medha Shankar is enough to make anyone fall in love with her. BGM could have been a little better. Cinematography is nice and overall, movie sticks to realistic plane.The story that shows the story of struggle and success touches you deep within. You feel for the character since the beginning and celebrate his success as if he were your peer. The bonding the character manages to develop is amazing. We want him to succeed. And at the end, when he indeed successes, what a beautiful scene it was. The way both he and Shraddha rolls down crying. The way Manoj goes back to Dushyant and thanks him, the way he calls his mother, the way his father feels proud. It was all so great.Another scene that stuck with me was, when a character fails his 6th attempt, he opens his tea stall and start guiding others. It was so easy for the director to show that he committed suicide, after all the buildup that the movie attributed to him. But it was a nice gesture. But then there is a scene where that tea wala bhaiyya lectures the English medium student. That felt a bit too over the top and unnecessary.Romanticise upsc
Imaandari
English medium look down uponNow coming to philosophy, this is where I have got some problems with the movie. In my eyes, the movie unnecessarily romanticises UPSC and works as a motivation detox. I am not a huge advocate of motivation industry myself. So, I didn't find the motivational undertone very becoming of the movie. The movie stresses that one should never give up and should always restart and that is all fine, but without a proper subject and rational of thought, this becomes just blind motivation.Then, the whole subplot about honesty. I guess the movie handled it nicely and neither became a cynic nor too preachy. I thing I didn't like that the movie glorified the poor while showing a negative sentiment for the English medium privileged kids. Honestly, I am quite fed up of this constant undertone in all Bollywood movies. Indeed the poor ones who makes lot of struggle to make ends meet and yet continue their battle deserve our utmost respect, but if the means to glorify them is to look down upon the privileged ones by showing the stereotypical rich rude kids, I don't think it's justifiable. Both rich and the poor has got despicable people that has nothing to do with their economical status. So, I didn't find it very welcoming from a director of the intelligence of VVC.Keeping these nitpicks aside, this is indeed a very well made movie glowing with the extravaganza of heroism. If you liked superheroes in your childhood, this is the one movie you should look up to.","2 November 2023","8/10"

Hats off to Vikrant Massey for portraying a practical and real character. One should watch this movie in nearby theatres so that more such kind of movies are made in the future.It's trailer itself is eyepleasing, but believe me the entire movie is much beyond the trailer and the fact that it's based on true events make it one of the finest movies in the Indian cinema.It's a must watch movie for all the youths despite the fact that you are preparing for UPSC or not. You'll get to know that reasons for not putting proper efforts in your preparation for anything is not the things you tell to others it's just inside yourself.

"18","Movie","12th Fail","dhunjiwadia","Some things are done for the love of it. And some things are done for the money. But it's wonderful when you make a movie for the love of it and it also makes money. I gather, 12th Fail is well on the way to becoming a financial success too.12th Fail is a big pass with distinction. It impresses and inspires. It is a cinematic triumph that excels in every department.Vidhu Vinod Chopra's artistry shines through in every frame, turning moments into magic. He's a master story-teller. Writing and Directing a film after many years, with aplomb and ease. Film-making runs in his veins. He understands every facet of the medium.Right from the start of the movie Sarita Joshi, as Dadi, sets the pace and tenor of the film when she censures the daroga who comes with the suspension notice.Vikrant Massey is mostly good in whichever role he plays. But this portrayal of real-life IPS Officer Manoj Kumar Sharma demands more. And he rises to the occasion and how! He takes us through a tornado of emotions from innocence, anger, dexterity, happiness and more. Medha Shankar provides strong support. As do the entire ensemble of actors. Not one of them looks out-of-place or miscast.Special mention for cinematographer Rangarajan Ramabadran who makes fluid use of the camera, that's unseen in Hindi films.The anthem, Restart, lingers on for a long time. We expect no less from Shantanu Moitra who has also created the background score.We as cinephiles deserve cinema that respects us. It's about time.","10 November 2023","9/10"

The movie is an earnest telling of a true story that really speaks to the power of try try again. Vikrant Massey puts in a very strong performance as Manoj Kumar Sharma and really makes the audience empathize with the plight of the character and the unfair rigged system that he is up against.

"26","Movie","Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama","ericstevenson","The version I saw was 2 hours and ten minutes long, but I heard there's other versions that are much longer. It's always interesting to learn about the animation of other countries and this film, apart from being a well known piece of Indian animation is actually part anime as it was literally collaborated on my Japanese animators. It's weird, because I know little about the relationships of those two countries. I know very little about Hinduism, but am always glad to learn something new. This movie features the tale of Prince Rama fighting against the evil Ravana. I know little about the actual Ramayana poem, nor about the Vedas or any of the Hindu holy text in general.The only thing that was familiar to me was the brief mention of chakra, which has been referenced in various anime. Well, it only fits as it is part anime. I think it's great to see a movie that combines two Asian countries. The animation in this film is absolutely gorgeous. You can definitely see some anime influence but it's still unique to the style of India. I love how Rama is actually smart and attacks Ravana while he's regenerating. Granted, he couldn't just do that forever, but he's smarter than most protagonists. I am glad to watch this movie to understand HInduism more.I remember taking a course in religion awhile back, which is probably the most familiar I am with Eastern religion. I think it's great to learn about other cultures. I don't know if I'm offending any Hindus with this review. I just wanted to watch a great movie and that's what I got. The designs are all great. It's hard to really praise the plot or anything because it's based on a classic piece of literature I am not familiar with. I always want to learn about other countries, especially the ones that have over a billion people! ***1/2","26 September 2016","9/10"

"28","Movie","Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama","deepakyadavhp","I was 11 or 12 when i first watch this movie on TV.
And i was like WOW. i have already watched the Ramayana series by Ramanand Sagar which is an epic, but it had told the story in a number of episodes... while here we got the main story of prince Rama in 170 minute, although it didn't cover the whole epic but it still amazes me. The voice over actors did their best especially Amrish Puri, he had done some very memorable villainous roles in some of the best Hindi movies and i think this is one of them. While Arun Govil has played Rama in Ramamnand Sagar's Ramayana that's why his voice seems very suitable for the role to me and many who has seen the TV series.And now lets talk about the animation...its marvelous if we compare it with the time it was produced in especially in India. where there is no animation movie been release before. This movie has give me some best memories of my childhood and that is why i still remember it. I am 19 years old by the way.","26 October 2012","8/10"

I appreciate the efforts of the director Mr. Yugo Sako to have done such a lot of research. The songs are heart rending. It is a movie to be viewed by anyone who is really interested in Ramayana. Hats Off to all who contributed in making this movie. The characters are portrayed very beautifully . The best part is every detail of the original Valmiki Ramayana has been shown which also makes it very informative. Also the songs make the whole aspect of the movie complete and provide entertainment. I specially like the music which has been composed by Mr. Vanraj Batia and the lyrics of the songs are very meaningful although they are is Sanskrit. Only flaw is that , Ram was a very powerful personality and that is why people used to like him . So ram's character should have been portrayed in a better way. But never mind that I like the efforts put in to make such a great movie. The best part is a Japanese Person made a movie on an Indian mythology!!","15 October 2005","10/10"

Kudos to Yugo Sako and his team. Both the english dub and hindi dub (Arun Govil) is awesome. The downside is that the frame rate of animation looks even less than 30fps. Other than that, i don't find any flaw in the film.
P.S. The music and songs are melodic and awesome. You'll fall in love with the songs

"34","Movie","Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama","lingamanenijaswanth","Many don't know that this was actually made by Japan as a friendship bond between India and Japan. A perfect depiction is made into this Anime. Wonderful 😌. Bollywood seriously needs to learn from this movie, Japanese makers have more knowledge than Bollywood.There's a correction in the movie. Vanara's army has been continuously called as Army of monkeys, which is false. Monkeys were called Kapi or Markata in Sanskrit. Kishkindha, kingdom of Vanara's is current day Hampi, Karnataka. In Sanskrit 'Vana' means 'Forest' & 'Nara' means 'Man' which literally means Men of the Forest. Many misunderstands that Vanara's came only from Kishkindha to war. But the truth is on Sugreev's order, Vanara's came from whole of the earth such as Vindhyas, Tibet, 'Ilavarta-varsha', a place where there was dark and light for 6 months i.e Polar regions as mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana. According to Valmiki, Vanara's were even described as 'Kapi-Kunchara' which means Elephant sized Monkeys in Sanskrit.Description of Vanara's in Ramayana exactly matches with Anthropological features of Neantherthel men such as big and sloppy foreheads, residing in caves, humaid bone, hairy bodies, protruding jaw bone, etc. We can still find interconnected mountain caves in Hampi even today, which was residence of Sugreev's army. Neantherthel men said to gone extinction by atleast 2,30,000 years by modern researchers. Tails of Neantherthel men were never proven to be existed as tails had no bones and flesh of the tails decay sooner.NOTE: Ramayana is an 'Ithihas' i.e. History not any mere mythology. 'Theory of Evolution', 'Homo Sapiens (we) evolved only 200,000 years ago' - All these are western scientist's statements. As Vedic culture is the only culture, which describes history beyond 10,000 BC, the world is described well in both Ramayana and Mahabharata.Jai Shree Ram 🏹","17 May 2021","10/10"

It took me a while to figure out exactly who was the brother of whom and what everyone's names were.

"48","Movie","Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama","rucharruchar","Positive :-ANIMATION - i can't believe or expect this kind of Animation from india in 1992.The animation is so smooth and if this movie got support in that time, then i am definitely sure that india's animation will be on another level today.BGM & SONGS - the songs of this movie is so soothing and nostalgic. I love those songs. Even BGM is quite interesting.CINEMATOGRAPHY - the viewing angles to present animation is superb. Even, this kind of thing is missing from present animations. I will recommend you to watch this thing carefully and you will recognise their effort.REVISION - this movie is best for revision of ramayan and those people who don't know anything about ramayan will get a rough idea about it.CHARACTER DESIGNS - these are so cool and after knowing the fact that this movie was released in 1992, i got surprised because the character design surpass or equal to today's animation.ACTION - the war scenes are also amazing and worthful to watch. They contains different tactics which are cool. In short, they are not boring in nature and doesn't feel like of old age.ANIME - i watched this movie, because it is one of the earliest prominent work of the indian animation. And i am right, because in some places, this movie gives you anime vibes and you don't feel this movie as a failure or out of the place.VISUALS - the way they show the visuals is amazing. If you use your brain while watching to concentrate, you will find that some visuals has very deep meanings. I mean that visuals are enough to give you a message without any use of dialogues, narrations, musics etc. I saw this technique in ""your lie in april"" too. And i love this thing.Negatives :-STORY - i know whole story of ramayan even from my childhood. So there is no point of judging the story as we all know what will happen next. But i found that they fast forward the story many times. But it is not their fault, because they have to compile whole ramayan in a single movie.DUBBING - i feel the Dubbing quality low. The way characters are talking and their expressions is weird.Presentation - in some aspects, the movie doesn't present the story in a better way.DON'T WATCH - i will recommend you, that don't watch this movie, if you already knew the whole ramayan deeply because story of the movie doesn't provide you anything new about ramayan.","18 August 2022","9/10"

Based on a real-life don, Varadarajan Mudaliar, Nayagan was praised by critics and audience alike, a rarity in India. Illayaraja's music is haunting. ""Tenpaandi Cheemayile"", sung by Kamal Hassan, is a classic. Photography is brilliant. Mani Ratnam is top-of-the-pops. Sign of things to come?

Manirathnam has done a wonderful job in re-creating the life and times of a local mafioso in the slums of Bombay. The art direction is flawless, and captures the time period perfectly. The music by Illayaraja is haunting, and reflects the nostalgic music of the early 70s. However, the high point of the movie is the excellent performance of Kamal Hassan. His potrayal of Velu-Nayakan is by far the best I have seen in Indian movies. The Hindi remake of this movie is sub-standard and poor. I highly recommend this movie to someone who has never seen it before.","21 February 2001","10/10"

Nayagan is probably one of the best movies made in Tamil(and may be in any Indian language). Apart from changing the very face of movie making in India, it had send so many refreshing trends.Nayagan is the story of a boy(Velu), who loses his father(a Trade Union leader) and runs away to Bombay, after assualting the Police who kills his father. In Bombay he is brought up by a pious Muslim fisherman. By turn of events, Velu is pulled into committing Crime(and fighting too). Velu grows into a Don and slowly the power of it takes him to a different world, where he is the command, but he slowly losses his dear ones and it finally ends with his death at an old age, with a moral message that one who lives by the sword(gun), dies by it.Kamal had given one of his best performances in this movie, for which he rightfully won the National Award for Best Actor. The Music of Illayaraja, Photography of P C Sreeram and the Art of Thotta Tharani were other High points of the movie, not to mention the magical touch of Manirathnam, who made a permanent name for himself after making Nayagan.A must watch movie, for anyone who hasn't seen it.","14 August 2001","10/10"
"56","Movie","Nayakan","AvinashPatalay","""Nayagan"" is akin to a rare astronomical event wherein the constellations form a perfect alignment to create a spectacular extravaganza. Mani Ratnam, Kamal Hassan & Ilayaraja weaved magic that captured the heart of audience by storm. There cannot be a second opinion if I were to state that this role was destined for one and only Kamal Hassan. You cannot fail to notice the subtle changes in the body language, mannerism, gait and dialogue delivery that go about with the ageing process of the Sakthivelu. Starting with the rebel youth and all the way to the ageing Godfather, the natural transformation was effortlessly essayed by Kamal. Saranya, Ravi, Kartika, Nasser and Tinnu Anand leave a mark otherwise there isn't much scope for supporting star-cast. Ilayaraja compositions were a raging hit back then. P C Sriram (cinematography) & Thota Tharani (art direction) ensured to give a distinct Mani Ratnam feel to the visuals (a spillover of ""Agni Natchathiram""). Though the plot rests on the basic premise of Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"", top notch writing narrating the biography of Mumbai based Tamil gangster of the 80s, Varadarajan Mudaliar stands to its own.If ""Mouna Ragam"" and ""Agni Natchathiram"" got him noticed then ""Nayagan"" stamped the title of maverick to Mani Ratnam. It goes without saying that while ""Nayagan"" set a precedent for fellow film-makers, Mani Ratnam started the revolution in the Tamil cinema. PS: The Hindi remake, ""Dayavan"" attempted by Feroz Khan and Vinod Khanna was sadly a classic case of ""lost in translation"".","26 May 2011","10/10"
"57","Movie","Nayakan","murali83","now, lets get this straight, godfather was a bad adaptation of the novel and that becomes one of the all time best movies. if manirathnam makes a movie out of the real life story of velunayagam mudaliar then it is called a remake of godfather, what crappy logic is this.In all aspects the movie is perfect, acting by kamal, direction is amazing and mind blowing music by the maestro Illayaraja.set in the slums of bombay, it shows the life of velu who becomes a local don just like it happened in the true life of velunayagam mudaliar. the dialogues are memorable and the dialogue between kamal and his grandson is something that i can never forget.watch it rightaway and stop this crap about it being a remake of godfather.

A fantastic star cast(Kamal Haasan, Nasser, Janakaraj), splendid direction(Mani Rathnam) and excellent music score by the maestro Illayaraja made the movie do wonders in the box office. Kamal Haasan, who was already a super star when this movie was made, proved that he can get into any ones shoes. Here he played the role of an angry young man who becomes a Mafia don with almost the entire city supporting him. With this movie and a National Award for the Best Actor, he came to be known as the best actor in Indian Cinema.Mani Rathnam became a nation-wide celebrity with this movie and every movie he made after Nayagan raised expectations among the audience.The story is that of a Mafia don, who is a kind of Robin hood for his own people, takes justice into his hands and kills the baddies. He earns respect from his people, incurs the wrath of the other underworld thugs, and is feared by the police, till a honest cop decides to challenge him. Though the story is similar to The Godfather, the way in which this movie is shot is different and keeps the viewer engrossed from the first scene till the end, when the 60 year old hero is assassinated in public for a brutal murder he did 30 years back.Nayakan - Slick, stylish and interesting.-Krishna","28 December 2004","9/10"

"63","Movie","Nayakan","planktonrules","This film is supposed to be based on the life of mobster Varadarajan Mudaliar. However, when I read up on this criminal's career, it was quite different from the guy in this film--very. While both were apparently beloved by the community, Mudaliar's real life death was incredibly boring and was nothing like the film. Additionally, while Mudaliar might have been a good guy in some ways, in real life he was responsible for the sale of narcotics--something not exactly heroic. There are probably man other differences. Suffice to say, the film is fiction.""Nayakan"" begins with a little boy being beaten by some cops. They want to know where the boy's father is but the kid won't talk. So, they let him go and follow at a distance. Then, when they found the father, they murdered him. his offense--being a union organizer. Later, at the funeral, the young boy, Ratnavelu, grabs a knife and stabs one of the policemen there. He then runs off to Mumbai (far from his Tamil roots in Southern India) and lives life on the streets--with no family and no home.Years pass. Now Ratnavelu is an adult and has learned the life on the streets well. Now he's a mobster--a mob boss who is adored by the poor. Considering his childhood, this shouldn't come as a big surprise. However, like Robin Hood, Ratnavelu ALSO tries to bring justice to the poor and is a very just man--in his own way. There's MUCH more to this movie than this--just see the film for yourself to see.Some of what is bad about this film is not the fault of the filmmakers and will only cause issues if you watch the Pyramid DVD. This is because too much of the dialog is NOT captioned! Why?! It could be worse--but at least they captioned the songs--something other video companies often don't do! Another problem I don't blame the filmmakers for is the tinny sounding music (yes, singing in a gangster film). In ALL the 70s and 80s Indian films I've seen, the sound of the music was pretty terrible. Fortunately, newer Indian films are VERY professional--among the best made and produced films in the world. What the filmmakers could have done better was the direction and editing. In one sloppy scene, the rooftop changes mid-scene--and as the sun went down, the two scenes were probably separated by 15 minutes or so--making the sun seem VERY weird in India! Apart from these cosmetic problems, the film was excellent. If you are making a film to glorify mobsters and make the police evil, you couldn't have done a better job. An interesting script and nice acting sure helped. Well worth seeing.","1 February 2014","10/10"
"64","Movie","Nayakan","SAMTHEBESTEST","Nayakan (1987) :
Brief Review -Mani Ratnam improvises multiple masala movie cliches in this Classic Semi-biographical Crime Drama with the help of Kamal Haasan's Iconic 'Velu Naikar'. Nayakan was an early classic in crime drama genre, a genre which was not explored fully till then in India. Hollywood had been making same films since 30s and most of them were Crime Noirs which still look superior even after long time. 'The Godfather' recieved universal acclaim for some valid reasons, one of the major factor was its timing. Hollywood was losing its shine after the golden period of 1930-1960s, then Musicals took over in the next decade and then 70s needed a change. The Godfather provided that, otherwise there are many better Classics made it in Old Hollywood but only some chunk of movie buffs Know it. What The Godfather did for Hollywood, Nayakan does for Tamil Cinema or to some extent, to Indian Cinema. It wasn't like every scene or frame in Nayakan is absolutely class or something like that, it has many references from 70s Masala Films of Bollywood and South industries. It is always said that Nayakan was based on the life of Gangster Varadarajan Mudaliar but even his life events differs so much from the film hence, that Semi-biographical tag. Actually, Nayakan is a film which has created those cliches we have been seeing in all gangster/crime dramas in last 30 years. Kamal Haasan as Velu Naikar will always remain iconic. His charisma in that role will never get old. Mani Ratnam's improvisation tactics of typical masala elements looks interesting and the reason is, an early attempt to discover something powerful in this 'not so good' genre. Nayakan is a complete package of a cinematic experience which does not disappoint you in any aspect, rather it gives you those first-time showcases of multiple cliches. Overall, a Classic Crime Drama and highly effective for its time.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.","3 June 2021","10/10"
"65","Movie","Nayakan","CinemaClown","A sprawling epic crafted with gusto & told with finesse, Mani Ratnam's Nayakan follows the journey of a man who takes a stand against injustice and becomes a messiah to the poor & impoverished, and captures his ascent to the top and the eventual downfall that always awaits men with too much power & influence.Brilliantly directed by Mani Ratnam, the film breathes authenticity in atmosphere with its era-appropriate backdrop, and aptly covers the constant struggle of poor against the powerful & corrupt. Ratnam is never in a hurry, letting several scenes play out in their entirety to paint a realistic portrait, and his direction is excellent throughout.The real show-stealer however is Kamal Haasan whose commanding performance brims with both formidable quality & emotional sincerity. The film never for once shies away from showing the moral dilemma he faces several times and the heavy toll he pays for taking the mafia road. And the notable actor articulates all that & more with exactness.On an overall scale, Nayakan remains one of Indian cinema's finest achievements and is still more than capable of surprising the newcomers. The customary songs & dance numbers do hamper the ride slightly but Mani Ratnam's controlled work behind the camera & Kamal Haasan's impressive act in front of it makes Nayakan a must-see for anyone venturing into India's filmmaking scene.","12 January 2020","9/10"

He came to be known as one of the godfathers of modern gangsterdom. Some other prominent names during his period were Karim Lala, etc. The days he spent fighting Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray who tried to run the Tamils out of Mumbai are golden days in history. Probably, the respect and influence Varadaraj Mudaliar had among the public inspired people like Dawood Ibrahim and others to take to such businesses. Mani Ratnam deserves full credit for the subject and screenplay. Kamal Hassan at the best of his career at an age of 32 playing the character of a 60-year-old man so perfectly with utmost ease.","5 October 2005",NA
"73","Movie","Nayakan","Vivekmaru45","I am very privileged to write this review for my hero, actor Kamal Hassan. I have seen most of his well known films: Sadma, Ek Duje Ke Liye, Saagar, Appu Raja, Hindustani, Puspak (a.k.a. The Love Chariot 1988), Chachi 420.I adore all the above films of his. You can collect of the above movies and it will be a good collection to start with.This film written and directed by Mani Ratnan, got rave reviews across India. Kamal Hassan's performance in this film earned him a Best Actor award. Maniratnam earned accolades from all over India and became popular overnight.The film also earned National Award for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction.Nayagan (which means 'Hero' or 'Leader') is based on the real-life Bombay underworld don Varada or Varadarajan Mudaliar, and sympathetically depicts the struggle of South Indians living in Bombay (now Mumbai). The lead character is played by Kamal Haasan, and the film also stars Saranya, Karthika, Nassar, Delhi Ganesh and Janagaraj. The soundtrack of the film was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.The film was nominated by India as its entry for the Best Foreign Language Film for the Academy Awards in 1987. In 2005, Time Magazine included Nayagan in its ""All-Time 100 Best Films"" list.[1] The film was remade in Hindi as Dayavan in 1988, with Vinod Khanna playing the part of Saktivelu and with Feroz Khan and Madhuri Dixit playing the roles of Selvam and Neela. A dubbed version of the film was released as Velu Nayakan in 1999.Plot: Sakthivelu Nayakar (Kamal Hassan), the protagonist, is born to an anti-government union leader. The child, Velu, is tricked by the police into locating his father, and then witnesses his father's death in a police shootout. Then after doing the final rites for his father, he kills the person who was the cause for his father's death. Orphaned, he escapes to Bombay.Stranded and homeless in the big city, he is rescued by a kind-hearted Muslim fisherman who takes him into his home in the sprawling suburban slums of Dharavi. His foster-father is also a small-time smuggler known for his generosity in the slum. Upon his running afoul of a senior crime lord, the corrupt local police officer Inspector Kelkar arrests the fisherman on smuggling charges, and is later murdered. Velu Naiker, now a young man who has come into his own, goes in search of the officer and bludgeons him to death.With this act, he is seen at once a saviour and a man to be feared amongst the slum residents. As their godfather and protector, he flourishes by resuming his dead foster-father's local smuggling activities. He marries a destitute school-girl-turned-prostitute (Saranya) and has two children. Conflicts and power struggles occur in the competitive web of the smuggling world, in which Velu's wife becomes a casualty. Velu's kids are sent away to Chennai as a result and return years later to their father's home, as young adults.The son, Surya (Nizhalgal Ravi), is eager to join his father in his activities, despite his father's reluctance. For his first real test, he is required to eliminate a potential witness against his father; he does this by hiring outside thugs. They succeed in eliminating the witness, but their failure to cover their tracks leads police to him at a petrol bunk and an accident costs him his life. Velu is heartbroken. Velu's daughter (Karthika) is at odds with her father over his form of justice and killings. To this he replies Ellariyum nerutha solu, appuram naan neruthuran. The death of her brother was the last straw for her and she cuts off her relationship with her father and leaves him.A newly appointed Assistant Police Commissioner (Nassar) starts afresh the hunt to bring Velu Nayakar to justice over his alleged activities and manages to secure an arrest warrant. This Commissioner is unknowingly Velu's son-in-law, as his daughter had secretly married him. After continued pursuit resulting in the beatings by police and self-immolation of slum dwellers, Velu surrenders to the police to spare the lives of the residents of his slum. He is tried in court but is released due to the lack of adequate evidence for his alleged nefarious activities. A supportive and emotional crowd gathers at the courthouse, awaiting Velu's release. Velu emerges to greet the tumultuous crowd but unexpectedly gets shot by Inspector Kelkar's retarded son, whom Velu had adopted, after he learns that Velu had killed his father long ago.The film has some very emotional moments: when Velu's wife his shot and he covers his children's eyes with her scarf, which eventually slips from his hands. When Velu visits his daughter's house for the very first time and is not allowed see his grandson. And towards the end when he learns that his daughter has given her son his own name. He wants to give his grandson some money as a gift to him, he reaches into his pocket and finds none. The final scene in the movie shows Velu dead lying on the same street in which he fought for the people and which he grew up on. I broke down crying when I saw that scene.Buy this great film on DVD, and watch it with your family and friends.GOD BLESS KAMAL HASSAN.Write to me Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com if you are a Kamal Hassan fan like me and we can chat about his films.Thanks for reading.","10 December 2010",NA
"74","Movie","Nayakan","peanutz454","I have lived most of my life in North India watching both Bollywood and Hollywood cinema. The first Tamil movie I saw was Roja (dubbed in Hindi) by director Mani Ratnam. The director's class was apart from any other Indian director. Clearly Ratnam was able to mix two genres of Indian Cinema that are the opposite ends of each other. Roja was both Art and Commercial (some would say neither.) I saw two more Ratnam movies and a lot of other Tamil movies before I saw Ratnam's Nayakan.Before I saw it, Nayakan was the kind of movie you hear people talk about with a certain air of sophistry. My Tamil friends showed me a lot of Tamil movies and then we would judge them. Mostly they tried to convince me the movie I just saw was good even though according to me it was not by any standard. I was beginning to feel Tamil cinema is about as bad as Hindi cinema. Hindi Cinema at least had a golden period; Tamil movies seemed to get worse as you went back in time. I blamed it on my lack of understanding of both Tamil language and Tamil culture. Ratnam I was starting to believe was a Hindi director.Nayakan was the first Mani Ratnam movie I saw in Tamil (subtitles.) By the end I was convinced that Nayakan is probably the best Tamil movie I have ever seen. It is impossible not to notice how much this movie is inspired from Godfather. The theme is similar, the movie follows the life of Velunayakan as he rises on to become an influential smuggler and fighter of people's cause in the slums of Dharavi (Bombay.) Nayakan is Indian version of Godfather both in its setting and its message (emphasis on Indianess). Though I am told that it is based on someone's real life. So mostly Ratnam is paying homage to The Godfather. Nayakan suffers from the cheesiness of most Indian movies, it suffers from what is called the item number - the rain dance, featuring a supposedly sexy dancer. How someone does anything but laugh at a dancing obese woman is only for Tamil movie buffs to explain. Since they explained it to me I will explain it here: the context that this mediocrity should be seen in is this - Tamil audience wants everything from a movie action, laughter, morality, and sex - but not really, sex is taboo. So they end up tantalizing themselves with glimpses of it in a dance. But as soon as you fast forward through this one song, Nayakan comes back to showing its strength again - and this time with a vengeance. What I saw of Nayakan in the first half was an average movie, if only you sit through till the end do you realize how strong the movie is. The direction the acting and the story all begin to mature in the second half of the movie.Nayakan is a very Indian movie and that too very Tamil. If you have never seen a Tamil movie you will not be able to appreciate Nayakan in one viewing. What will stand out will be the differences from the kind of movie you have seen. Those differences will over shadow the qualities that Nayakan has.I have said a lot of things about Tamil movies that paints a shoddy picture of Tamil cinema. But my views may suffer from a skew introduced by the small sample size. There probably are many good Tamil movies that I have not seen.**By the way, Nayakan was in Time Magazine's list of 100 best movies. May 2005 Issue I think.**","30 June 2005",NA

"83","Movie","777 Charlie","samxxxul","No wonder they say that man's best friend is a dog. There has been many movies made about self discovery, finding oneself and this is one of the best in that list. Here our Protagonist Dharma (Rakshit Shetty) is the kinda guy who'd be hated by kids and families in the neighbourhood. But he is also the kinda guy who values his solitude with anxiety simmering below the surface. His seemingly normal life of is suddenly unsettled, the constant ringing of his door bells, presence of people, all for the uninvited guest, our snow loving Charlie. It's only when he reintegrates with his surrounding which leads to a beautiful, affectionate, touching film, a journey that touches on topics of life, pet adoption, overcoming anxiety, and most importantly love. Firstly, many will be familiar with the key concept of the film and it be no longer surprising but trust me you will be proven wrong.From choo choo to naming Charlie after the great Chaplin, there are a lot of such touching moments in the film and i'm sure it will be very hard to hold back tears while watching. At the same time, the picture is a wonderful sketch of the soul of an ordinary Dharma and Charlie's last wish as they both find love, including a new addition to the family.To conclude ""777 Charlie"" is good movie with very little flaws, also it is cleverly constructed love story, where the emotions are truly at heart and it perfectly sums up ""The tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug."" I went to the film and knew that I would enjoy it and with a brilliant cast and a cute dog, which is impossible not to love. I strongly recommend to stop looking for similarities with other movies that shares the same theme and enjoy this wholesome journey.","10 June 2022","7/10"

"92","Movie","777 Charlie","arungeorge13","777 Charlie is packed with all tropes of a light-hearted dog movie, including a tear-jerker climax. The first half is certainly more engaging as we wonder how an emotionless loner taps into his inner self and connects with a stray Labrador pup (the adorable Charlie), making him a more expressive-but-composed human being. These bits are also laced with situational humor and a sparkling Raj B Shetty extended cameo - a complete 180 from his vicious turn in Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana. While the bond between Charlie and Dharma is charming and full of warmth, it also moves into predictable territory in the second half. The dog competition parts did not feel essential to the plot whatsoever, and watered down the emotional core to some extent.The foreseeable finale is also stretched beyond all measure, especially since you've been readily waiting with a box of tissues for a good while. The writing in 777 Charlie also comes from a hardcore pet lover's perspective, and therefore, while the emotions hit sufficiently hard, there's only so many times you can go aww whenever Charlie spontaneously hugs Dharma. I did relish the texture attributed to Dharma (it's shown that he lost his family while he was still a child) and therefore, the journey he takes in the second half with Charlie makes sense as he never got to do something like that (with a loved one) before.","29 July 2022","6/10"

The writing of the film is flawless, the emotional roller coaster ride gives you the perfect blend of emotions and drama.Rakshit Shetty has again given an impressive performance and he never disappoints his fans. His bonding with Charlie is a delight to watch. The female labrador Charlie's acts and her eyes will surely melt your heart. The cameos by Danish Sait and Bobby Simha will be loved by the viewers. Raj B. Shetty, Sangeetha Sringeri, and other supporting actors were fine in their roles.This is indeed A Tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug, which has been inspired by Dharmaraya's character of the Mahabharata where he reaches heaven alone and a dog follows him and he ensures the dog will go to heaven. The score and soundtrack of the film composed by Nobin Paul are refreshing. The direction, cinematography, editing, and screenplay, everything was perfect in the film.The movies like 777 Charlie come so rarely in our Indian film industry.

And the forced placement of foreigners acting so surprised? Lol. The premise of taking the dog to enjoy in the snow? That part was also weird. How did he know that was all the dog wanted to do?

"97","Movie","777 Charlie","sudhakaranakhilan","The Man-Animal relationship is something an important topic or subject for filmmakers because it is easy to build up so many emotional elements into it. Just remember the movies like Hatchi: A Dog's tale, A dog's purpose, etc we can find that kind of technique which makes the audience swirl into the depth of emotion even though the situation of pouring tears. I also belong to that category and shed tears while I finished Hatchi. 777 Charlie is similar to it, which leaves us from the theatre with wet eyes. Simply, the story of the movie relies on the relationship between Dharma (the protagonist) and Charlie (the other protagonist) with some top-notching emotional add-ups. How 'Keaton turned Charlie' came into the life of Dharma, who leads an untidy, lonely life, and how the influence of Charlie reshaped and revolve around his life, etc, are the main things that the movie discusses. Hats off to the wonderful performance of Charlie. He is the 'man (animal)' who stole everyone's heart. Along with Charlie, Rakshit Shetty also did his part brilliantly. Kiranraj, the director of the movie shaped everything from his own personal experience (he said so in an interview) and we can see the wholeness of the director in the film. He indirectly reflects his love for the legendary filmmaker Charlie Chaplin through he assigned that name to the protagonist. And also there is a slight director brilliance too in the movie where he named Keaton first to Charlie reflecting his love towards another filmmaker Buster Keaton. Directly or indirectly he just reveals his passion and admiration for the legends, both are comedians in the public domain but more than that when compared to their contribution to the film field. And I also noticed something in the film which looks comical in its aspect and that is the quote written on the waste bin near Dharma's house, the quote states that 'One man's trash is another man's treasure' and that quote remembers me another one that I heard on a film which also hit the theatres recently and that is 'One man's terrorism is another man's revolution. It was from Lokesh Kanagaraj's movie Vikram. Anyway, that remark was only for my satisfaction. Come back to the movie 777 Charlie, it is a beautifully executed saga of a Man and his pet.","12 June 2022","7/10"

"101","Movie","Gol Maal","Peter_Young","Hrishikesh Mukherjee directs another comedy movie involving simple middle-class people and presents it through their everyday struggle. The entire picture is simple, authentic and fun. The concept of a young guy who would go to any extent to not lose his job is very interesting, and Mukherjee handles it with great success. Gol Maal is a comedy of errors and it's wonderfully developed and narrated. It's not a complex story, but it's not a silly one either, and the simplicity works in its favour. The film benefits from its genuinely lifelike sets and costumes, its script, and its proceedings, which grow from humorous to amusing to suspenseful to hilarious. It gets funnier and funnier as it goes along, as the conflict gets more complicated, the obstacles are doubled, and the irony grows. But the movie also has soul, and that's one of its high-points. The characters are colourful and memorable, but they also have depth which makes them easy to identify with. The relationships are also very impressively portrayed and it's nice to see how united families and relatives can be and how they care for each other and help each other in times of need.Gol Maal is very well cast, and for me, there are three actors who totally nail their parts: Amol Palekar, Utpal Dutt and Dina Pathak. Palekar is excellent in the role of a simpleton who is forced to live a double life in order to save his job. He displays the differences between the two roles his character has to play brilliantly, with just subtle change in body language and a few nuances here and there. Dutt is hilarious, skillfully creating a memorable persona of a strict boss with a soft heart. His is the funniest performance in the film. Dina Pathak, one of Hindi cinema's greatest character actresses, is awesome as she is in all the films I've seen her in. She comes across as a vivacious, fun-loving and kind woman and, like Palekar, wonderfully plays her 'two' roles. Among the supporting cast, David stands out and is as always likable as the kind uncle. The film also has fantastic music by maestro R.D. Burman. ""Aane Wala Pal"" is my favourite number, and it is performed to perfection by the great Kishore Kumar. Gol Maal is overall a lighthearted and heartwarming comedy but it has the power to captivate, and it can always provide a fun watch for the entire family.","23 September 2011","8/10"

It's comedy at its best.The casting is superb, with Amul Palekar, Dina Pathak, Utpal Dutt, Manju Singh, and of course, a whole lot of special appearances.The story is quite ridiculous at times, but the acting and music more than makes up for it. Some of the sequences such as Ramprasad's interview with Utpal Dutt and the scene where Dina Pathack comes into their house through the window, are out of this world. It makes me wonder, what ever happened to good Indian comedies?? The story resolves quite nicely, and all well that ends well. Basically, a thoroughly enjoyable film.","3 August 2006","9/10"

"108","Movie","Gol Maal","Chrysanthepop","Well first thing's first. If you liked 'Chupke Chupke' (another comedy of error by Mr. Mukherjee) then you'll almost certainly enjoy 'Gol Maal'. Mukherjee does what he's very specialized in doing: telling the simple story of the common man and this time again he does it with comedy. The film opens with the hilarious title song and the story slightly falls on the same line of Mukherjee's 'Chupke Chupke' but the humour and the actors make the moments their own and 'Gol Maal' is very much its own film. Amol Palekar as the simpleton who is 'forced' to live a double life, Utpal Dutt as the opinionated boss and Dina Pathak as the vivacious mother/aunt create a wonderful comic team. Lending support are Manju Singh as the happy-go-lucky sister, Deven Verma as...himself and a cute Bindiya Goswami as the love interest. One will notice several cameos by stars like Rekha, Amitabh Bachchan etc. 'Gol Maal' presents several situations of confusion, suspense, and drama - all of it with a touch of comedy. The only thing that slightly irritated me was the poor cinematography as the camera was a little too shaky at times. I was watching it really late at night (a time during which most normal people have already entered REM sleep) and couldn't stop laughing. I think it would have been a lot more entertaining had I watched it with my parents (as was the case with 'Chupke Chupke'). Perhaps thats because there's the additional comedy of watching them laugh out loud.","15 February 2008","8/10"
"109","Movie","Gol Maal","hprashantarora","A comedy of errors in which a lie and a mistaken identity sets into motion a domino effect of such proportions that every time a character faces an obstacle your heart leaps into your mouth, only to fall back with a thud because you continuously feel the urge to laugh uncontrollably.Like any Hrishikesh Mukherjee movie, Gol Maal tells the story of next door people in the most heart-warming manner with a good dose of clean and genuine humor that takes a clean bite at the culture and traditions of middle-class India. Ramprasad Sharma (Amol Palekar), a chartered accountant by profession, is a colorful personality who is a sports junkie in the afternoons and an amateur singer in the evenings. With the help of his uncle he lands up a job at a trading firm and embarks on a mission to please his boss Bhavani Shankar (Uttpal Dutt in a hilarious turn) because his whole identity is fake considering his boss disapproves fashion, vehemently opposes the obsession of sports among the youth (although he is a secret sports fan himself), dislikes people who abbreviate their names and use recommendation to get a job, encourages purity of language, and sees mustache as a symbol of pride and a window to the soul. Ramprasad has none of the ""good"" qualities sans the mustache, his only saving grace, which he ends up losing in an attempt to save his skin after being spotted at a Hockey match by his boss. Remembering the plot of a movie an actor friend of his is doing, he manages to convince Bhavani Shankar that it was not him whom he had seen at the stadium but his jobless, good-for-nothing, clean shaven identical twin Laxmanprasad Sharma aka Lucky. So, during the day Ramprasad works as a straight-as-a-reed worker bee quoting quasi intellectual teachings of his imaginary father and in the evening takes on the role of his mustacheless notorious twin brother who teaches music to the boss's daughter and also romances her on the sly.Hrishikesh Mukherjee, once again succeeds in creating a complex story around some simple and some quirky characters like Mrs. Kamala Srivastav (Dina Pathak) – a reluctant mother for hire and Bade Babu (Yunus Parvez), a not so bright colleague of Ramprasad whose favorite pastime is pulling hair out of his nostrils. He went so far as to mount this broad satire on the platform of Bollywood itself wherein an actor friend of Ramprasad Deven (Deven Varma as himself) mouthpieces the idea that life indeed is stranger than fiction as depicted in the movies and does the humble job of furnishing the fake mustache to the protagonist, the complex results of which sets the whole hanky-panky business into motion.The rest of the cast is mediocre except for Shobha Khote and David in minor roles. Bindiya Goswami as the love interest only shines in her introduction scene and has nothing better to do except look lovelorn. Needless to say, it is the comic timing between Uttpal Dutt and Amol Palekar that is the star of the movie and the two went on to do three more films together with mixed results.","9 February 2010","10/10"
"110","Movie","Gol Maal","abladabla","This is the best comedy I have seen so far. Neither has such a comedy ever been produced again, not it will be. Utpal dutt is just great and so is Amol Palekar. Two great actors and very well supported by Dina Pathak. Bollywood, why have you stopped making such excellent movies. I have seen it 20 times and each time I see it, I like it even more. I know almost all main dialogues of the movie now. Wondeful film and must watch. I would give it a 10/10.","6 December 2003","10/10"
"111","Movie","Gol Maal","jmathur_swayamprabha","First of all, I sincerely thank my dear friend and esteemed MS member - Deepak Ji (@deepak27) for inspiring me to write a review of this classic comedy by the legendary director - Hrishikesh Mukherjee. I am sorry Deepak Ji for being late in posting this review. The delay took place because I wanted to watch it again before writing the review.Golmaal (1979) is one of the best and (commercially successful) movies of the perennial simpleton of Bollywood movies of the seventies - Amol Palekar. However, despite his straightforwardness, sincerity to work and middle-class manners, he is not that simpleton in this movie. He is smart enough to tackle his practical problems with the contingency approach of management and befool his employer by creating the fake identity of his look-alike twin brother. And this is the Golmaal (confusion / hodgepodge) in this movie which consists of not only the fake mother of the hero and his sister but also her (fake) look-alike twin sister as well. The end result of this Golmaal is plain and simple - laugh-filled healthy entertainment for the audience.Ram (Amol Palekar) is an orphan who lives with his sister Ratna (Manju Singh) and needs a decent job after passing the C.A. exam (just like the writer of this review). His maternal uncle - Kedar (David) directs him to an industrialist Bhavaani Shankar (Utpal Dutt) who is not only orthodox and old-fashioned but also a bit finicky. He does not like youths taking interests in extra-curricular things and has a special disliking for the clean-shaven males (not sporting a mustache). Ram presents himself before him the way he wants his employee to be and soon wins his confidence through his sincere work too. However the trouble starts with his being caught by Bhavaani Shankar while watching a Hockey match. Now to save his job, he creates the fake story of his vagabond look-alike twin brother - Lakshman. A new twist arrives with Bhavaani Shankar's hiring Lakshman's services to take music tuition of her daughter - Urmila (Bindiya Goswami). The young pair falls in love. Further, since Ram had taken leave to watch the Hockey match under the excuse of his mother's illness, now he has to create a fake mother also who is a theatre artist - Kamla Srivastav (Deena Pathak). Even worse, when she is caught by Bhavaani Shankar in a party, her fake twin sister is also to be created. And the climax comes when Bhavaani Shankar decides to marry his daughter to Ram but she is willing to marry Lakshman (without knowing like her father that both are the same). The laughter-filled climax leads to the union of the lovers and clarity of everything before Bhavaani Shankar (i.e., resolution of the Golmaal).The story based on the plot of fake identities and the lies spoken is not only full of laughs and entertaining sequences but also touches at several places through the human relations and sentiments among the middle class people. The brother-sister relation, the mother-daughter as well as the mother-son relation and the concern of the benevolent maternal uncle for his nephew and niece, everything is heart-warming and creating sublime feelings in the heart of the viewer. The characters of the helping friends of the hero are also to be seen in this context. Right from the start to the very finish, the movie is highly entertaining and impressive by all means.Amol Palekar was a master in performing such roles and it is undoubtedly one of his best performances. The artist matching him in performance is Utpal Dutt. Their amazing on-screen chemistry was later seen in Naram Garam too (which I found even better than Golmaal). Both these great actors have generated unlimited fun for the audience with their hilarious interactions. Deena Pathak, Manju Singh, Deven Varma, David and the other supporting actors in cameos, everybody has done well. Bindiya Goswami has filled the quota of heroine.Director Hrishikesh Mukherjee demonstrated his mastery in not only profound movies but also comedies. Golmaal was a box office hit because it effortlessly won the heart of the Indian audience. The movie does not contain a single boring scene. It starts hilariously and it ends hilariously as well. A perfect entertainment.Technically the movie is up to the mark. Hrishi Da's movies are always wrapped in simplicity. The same is with Golmaal. A middle class family environment has been maintained throughout the movie and there is no artificiality visible anywhere, may it be the office or the households. The length of the movie is also optimum.R.D. Burman has composed admirable music for the movie with the lyrics being penned by Gulzaar. The title track, Ek Din Sapne Mein Dekha Sapna and Ek Baat Kahoon Jo Maano Tum are all good. However the best number is Kishore Kumar's classic song - Aanewaala Pal Jaanewaala Hai.Golmaal has enormous repeat value. Anybody who watches it once, likes to watch it again. Hence I recommend this classic comedy from Bollywood cinema unconditionally to all and sundry. Watch this laugh-filled story embedding Indian family and social values once on my recommendation and you will undoubtedly watch it for the second time without anybody's recommendation.","15 August 2011","8/10"

"113","Movie","Gol Maal","michaelgfalk","This is the perfect comedy! It has all the hallmarks of the genre. A delightful, optimistic young hero. A tempestuous young heroine. A stiff and prejudiced father. A garrulous uncle. A tough and sentimental aunt. Dopey friends. Misunderstandings. Seemingly unending conflict and a hilarious resolution.Amol Palekar shines as the hero, Ram. His character is absurdly unrealistic. He is a feckless youth and a devoted nephew and brother. He has a wicked sense of humour and strong religious devotion. He is a brilliant accountant and has a raft of boring opinions of Kabir. He is an incredibly hard worker and yet has a thriving social life. He loves sport more than anything else, but will sacrifice it for a job and for love. Ram is a chameleon, a supreme actor, and Palekar is utterly convincing as each of Ram's altar egos.The rest of the main cast are equally brilliant. Deven Verma is the best friend a young guy could ask for. Bindiya Goswami has just the right balance of disobedience and daughterly devotion to be utterly charming. Dina Pathak is hilarious as Kamla, the part-time actress who climbs through kitchen windows. And Utpal Dutt is nearly unbeatable as the fierce potential father-in-law, who thinks that only men with moustaches and without hobbies or nicknames have any value in modern India. He reminded me of Walter in Sterne's classic novel ""Tristram Shandy,"" a man of great status and absurd beliefs, but withal extremely likable.Like all the best comedies, this one takes place in a world just a little bit different from our own. Everyone is flawed, but there is no harm in that. Everyone misunderstands one another, but in the end all difficulties melt in the breeze.The plot unfolds breezily, and complication piles on complication as Ram's schemes get increasingly involved. I was grinning or laughing the whole way through, and I think you will too. 10/10","22 October 2016","10/10"

This one is no exception.It will always give you a feeling of freshness even if you watch it continuously for a week. Pleasant is the one word I would like to associate with this movie in it's true sense. Utpal Datt is outstanding in his act, but he is Amol Palekar who stole the show.

"117","Movie","Gol Maal","mishaone","This is one of my favorite Hindi comedies of all time, as it is completely family friendly, has some genuinely hilarious moments and adheres to a subtlety in comedy which seems lost in the gyrating Govinda era of Hindi comedies.This is one of the few movies one can watch with the entire family and everyone, from the oldest to the youngest member, will enjoy it.A comedy of errors, our story begins with young CA grad Ram Prakash Sharma who is looking for modest employment. Enter his uncle, who advises him on how to behave to gain a position at the uncle's childhood friend, Bhawani Shankar's, company. Unfortunately, Bhawani Shankar is a man of strict tastes and fancies all young men of the time to be lazy and far too preoccupied with time-wasting activities such as sports, music and parties. Ram Prakash presents himself (according to the tutelage of his uncle) as the quintessential, too-good-to-be-true young man with no time for leisure and frivolities and all the time in the world for work and the serious things in life. Unfortunately, Ram Prakash's true self cannot be suppressed and he schemes to get out of work to watch a hockey match. Unluckiloy for him, Bhawani Shankar happens to see him at said match and confronts him, because of which Ram Prasad is forced to invent a twin, Laxman aka Lucky who is the very epitome of the sort of young man Bhawani Shankar detests. Things get further complicated when Ram Prasad is forced to invent a mother, having told Bhawani Shankar that she is still alive and ill as an excuse to go to the hockey match. What ensues due to the confusion is a tangled web of good old fashioned mix-ups and lies to keep the whole thing from falling in around Ram Prasad's ears.I would definitely recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys an interesting, non Givinda-esquire comedy, and of course, anyone who enjoys music as this movie has the very well known and loved Kishore Kumar number, ""Aane Wala Pal"".","21 January 2006","10/10"

"137","Movie","Rocketry: The Nambi Effect","Biswas_","This film is based on Scientist Nambi Narayanan and his contributions to liquid fuel engines in India followed by the incidents where he was wrongly held guilty for betraying his nation. This film is presented in an interview way where our beloved SRK interviews Mr. Nambi.I must say the biopic has been made in a very interesting way. It keeps you hooked till the very end. Occasionally there are light humorous moments and go very well with the flow. It is also quite informative about the journey of liquid fuel engines in our country. Towards the end, the film does get really emotional and you feel bad for Mr. Nambi when SRK pleads him for apology for what he went through.R. Madhavan absolutely nails this role. It seems he put in a lot of effort in making this film. Not only does he ace the humorous scenes but also kills it in the emotional scenes with his wife towards the end. He has lived this role. I think all the brownie points of this film is scored by Madhavan thanks to his direction as well, he has managed to make a film that is very engaging and enjoyable and emotional at the same time.Nambi's friends too give a very good performance especially that one friend who started stammering when he tried speaking to a beautiful lady was hilarious 😂. Nambi's wife too does a very good job.SRK has an extended cameo as the interviewer and must say, for such a small not so significant role like this, only a man with a big heart and yet being a big superstar can accept this role and that is SRK. Only big actor other than SRK was Amir Khan who is known to play such small cameos in films otherwise normally you see superstars denying such small role. SRK's last act where he begs for apology on behalf of whole nation stole the show.Negatives - i still can't believe how poorly foreign people are showcases in films . Till date they are portrayed as stereotypical and caricaturish characters . High time they be portrayed as more matured..Overall, a film that you must invest your money in and i guarantee you it will be worth your time and money.","2 July 2022","9/10"

"148","Movie","Rocketry: The Nambi Effect","natureboy-84907","R Madhavan aka Rocketry Madhavan , what a great movie to Debut with, as a Director . The movie is on Mr. Nambi Narayanan , an ISRO scientist who underwent so much of physical and mental trauma after getting framed of being a spy and arrested by Indian govt only to be later released confirming he's guilt free . Nambi is one successful scientist who had worked along with Dr Kalam sir in 1990s . It was a pleasure to know about this actual SuperStar born on 12th Dec who aimed for stars from our mother land . A movie made on him is now nothing less than an Absolute Sensation, this might not be even the apt word to mention the class of the movie , it's beyond words , may be beyond the blue sky , the stars , the galaxies possible beyond several planets . Gone are those days when I used to think Biopic's are the easiest to make , but this movie proved it wrong . So much hardwork put in by the entire crew. But for once we should agree it's definitely a Rocket Science, for few of the conversations with reference to it was a bit of challenge to understand :) still it's very minimal and ignorable . R Madhavan, one of the finest actor we have in the world cinema features as Nambi and does an extremely brilliant performance and adding to it beyond acting through this movie he also proves himself as a man with great visionary working from the seats of a director. Paired with him is Simran, she's one impeccable actress who can steal everyone's heart anyday by appearing onscreen even if it happened for a millisecond . Beyond these two there are definitely more stars to mention for their remarkable performances. Surya adds some attraction in a cameo role. The screenplay was almost flawless, the BGM, the CGI and the re-recording needs a special mention here. Dialogues in Tamil was top notch , extremely enjoyable . However the director could have avoided making the foreign nationals speak in Tamil which sounded more like the language spoken Shim Chan cartoons :). Again ignore and start your countdown to fly towards the movie hall to witness this Indian wonder. Overall Rocketry, a Mission to Oscars ! .","2 July 2022","9/10"

It teaches a valuable lesson. It explains what really God is and the true meaning life.The script and screenplay are awesome. There are some humor scenes. That fight could have been avoided. The theme song was really awesome. The song touched me very much. The music was awesome too. Other songs are good too, but not needed.Kama Hassan has given an excellent movie. Hats off to Kamal Hassan...Watch this movie. Learn the true meaning of life. You won't regret it. It's worth it.I give this movie a 9 out of 10.

"152","Movie","Anbe Sivam","ram_dhanush","Many rule out this movie as a non-masterpiece just because its a remake....I stick to what Ram Gopal Verma said, 'nothing is original'. In Hollywood, people make movies inspired sometimes by small or Eastern/European movies, then much of the time it is an adaptation of a novel. The director gets a huge team of writers to fine-tune the script. The result, a masterpiece. Here, Kamal single-handedly carried and executed this film. He was inspired by a Hollywood movie which was a slapstick comedy. Did the original say ""God is Love"" and tackled communist views? This should never be called a remake. Kamal's detail in acting proves he can beat any given actor in this world, I dare to bet. Even in scenes which does not highlight him, he reacts perfectly. Even the minute details was taken care of in his movements and face reactions, the muscles, and the handicap. The best part of this movie is actually the depth of characterization in Kamal and Madhavan, they lived as Nalla and A. Ars throughout the screening in my mind. I have never seen the depth of characterization as much as this movie in the recent past. Deserves to be in the top 250. Is this Internet Movie Database or American Movie Database? I hardly saw a move with a richer context than this. Indian movies do provide masterpieces once at a time, and please do recognize these efforts.","23 April 2007","9/10"
"153","Movie","Anbe Sivam","praveen1013","Why is Anbe Sivam regarded as the best movie in the history of Tamil cinema by many? Did this movie have any story at all? First of all is it a movie? No. Anbe Sivam is an experience, not only for one Madhavan but for another few thousands, who care to learn quite a lot of things and feel conceited about themselves, but fail miserably to confront the vagaries of life. What was the movie all about? An experienced matured man and a squeamish, egotist but tender hearted youth (a typical modern day youth) travelling together from Bhubaneshwar to Chennai(East coast of India).Fate hinders their journey in all possible ways which Madhavan initially considers exasperating but later reveres as an experience of a lifetime. The story is as simple as that but the associated scenes,dialogues and the lessons learnt reverberate through your mind for a long time.Be it the floods,train accident or the little boy's death it is Madhavan who breaks down and get shattered. But Kamalhassan adapts himself and reconciles himself to reality and helps in the best possible way he can. While it takes a lot of effort for Madhavan to tell Kamalhaasan about his fraternal love towards him, Kamalhaasan finds it easy to tell 'A.Ars, you are a go(o)d man' (it's not that easy to tell it to someone earnestly). From where did Kamal get this maturity? The story moves into the flashback of Kamal,a communist, who loves the daughter of a capitalist, Nasser, whom he opposes as a worker regarding wages. When the duo decide to elope to Kerala for marriage, their bus meets with a gory accident. Kamal is badly bruised losing a limb and is totally disfigured. While struggling in bed for life, Nasser speaks extremely rude and blatant to Kamal. On conjuring up the scenes after the accident, he evaluates stark contrast of Nasser and the sister. Kamal sees god through the sister and sees it subsequently in quite a lot of people who propagate love.His outlook changes completely. The first half with some lighter moments, the middle with some interesting dialogues and the last with some really shaking scenes Anbe Sivam stands tall amidst other usual Tamil movies. Madhavan is extraordinary communicating the emotions powerfully(especially in the climax dialogue with Kamalhaasan). The one fight scene in the middle could have been avoided. Rather than going abroad for shooting songs, this movie has brought out some really excellent locations in India( not only in machi machi song). The choice of season to shoot this movie has been brilliant with the monsoon accentuating the kind of feelings to be conveyed. Does the name 'Anbe Sivam' mean 'Anbarase Nallasivam' trying to say 'All are one soul'? Kamal only knows. Finally, I'm sure it would not take any effort for anyone who has seen this movie to say 'I love you Dr.Kamalhaasan' for such an excellent story and screenplay.","17 November 2006","10/10"
"154","Movie","Anbe Sivam","Odsingh","I watched the movie because of the stars - Kamal Hasan and Madhavan. I do not understand Tamil, yet the movie has been so well made that at times you do not feel that you need the dialogs.In brief, the movie shows two extremely different characters who are forced to spend time together due to circumstances.The movie tends to slow down in the middle, when it goes into the flashback of Kamal Hasan's life. However, for the most part, it is a pretty sensible piece of art - something that is a rarity in Bollywood. The movie could have been shorter - and that is the only complaint that I have. Otherwise, it is a brilliant idea that has been executed to near perfection.Kamal Hasan - as always - excels. Madhavan is great, too. The music score was really good.A must see!","2 July 2006","9/10"
"155","Movie","Anbe Sivam","mugamoodi7","Kamalhasan is known for his extraordinary performances in Indian cinema but this movie is something special for him for he has not acted but lived as Nallasivam . The movie speaks about an universal issue in the most simplest yet the beauties way. Special congrats to Madan for writing some mind storming dialog. Special congrats to Madavan for putting an wonderful performance that too when kamalhasan is present. The movie created a pain in every viewer's heart that remained for two or three days. I can compare this movie with any Hollywood drama for it has got everything love, philosophy, emotion, action above all an excellent way of telling the story. Indian cine industry can follow this at least from now or else they can never get noticed. In one line "" A movie that can knock the doors of Hollywood""","31 August 2006","10/10"
"156","Movie","Anbe Sivam","reachrajdream","This is one of the movies i missed during it's release like many,due to the feeling that this movie won't be interesting and entertainment factor will be less(lot of downside info like reportedly 60 Million loss for producers at 2003 and also director didn't take salary and in fact the latter director capped Sundar.C hinted that Kamal made this movie as an influence and to satisfy his intellectual associate. Indeed was in development hell briefly with Priyadarshan been replaced and also the heroine i guess). Finally i saw this movie and was shocked to know that an Indian feature film has good quality without any artificial entertainment.To my knowledge the theme of humanity i first saw was on the 1940 feature film ""The great dictator"",Schlinder's List and many great movies.But this movie was striking direct on it's theme with it's relevant plot. Actor Kamalhaasan is one of the few unique distinguished film personality in India who has been making career in Indian movies right from 1961 till date.With his well developed artistic talent he has been working hard on quality right from 1987 movie Nayagan(Listed on TIME magazine as one of the great movie of the century).I would say this movie is just not another feather on his cap,but something more then that. With his singing of theme song on this movie is deep and emotional high. The hidden theme from the Nallasivam character is that he recovers from death to life because of love, besides opposing the selfish,fraud, phony people in the world.Its always easy to be an god fearing person in our society for security and selfish reason.But to be an atheist,not easy.We need to fight,oppose this selfish ,dishonest society every day. There are lot of signs this movie is classic and timeless as the story is more into emotional side of humans plus life. The movie seemed to be on about love, but it ended up saying about not loved-Loneliness, which is a classic progression.The story plot is simple,it's purely into character of Kamal and Madhavan.Madhavan and Kamal have done great job on their role.Madhavan is advertisement film maker and Kamal is communist theater actor,with artistic talent and simple human whose life is entirely an example of humanity. Example for his humanity is that he raises the dog which was the reason behind his disastrous accident and shattered his life.Beauty of forgiveness is well explained there.Especially the acting of dog(that too in climax) is up to the point which indeed shows the perfection of work and when lead actor says the dialogue ""pozhachu ponga"" it looks like he told the same for his haters who did politics against him and anti-Kamalians. And not to miss mentioning is actor Nasser performance, especially when he says ""sethu PO"" will be all time best hardcore villain dialogue(Can watch this piece when you are let down by life and life's people to get empowered to live well and confidently against the oppositions of life). I guess all the movie after Rare brothers(1989) by Mr. Kamal is been directed by himself(may be except director Shankar/Maniratnam i guess) and his directors are always Assistant/Associate director. This mention is not to take away credit of the director and let them down but it shows Mr. Kamal's command on creativity. In fact my interest in movie was in because of this movie and for many i guess, as Tamil film director Bala even stated his Naan Kaduval(2009) and the title indeed inspired from this movie. Especially this movie is medicine for people who are wounded by inhumanity and loneliness.The only boring part of this movie is insertion of communism(propaganda tone is indeed inevitable), which might be the influence of Movie genius Chaplin and Tamil writer Jayakanthan. Journalist/Writer/Cartoonist Madhan has done a great job in dialogues, as he is one of the original, knowledgeable creative person in Tamil Nadu. I wish he collaborates again with Kamal.On the downside the film is more of a character drama, missing wholesome entertainment/theme which strikes our heart easy and cool.. The tone of self pity and sentiment is over the top, but still everybody has to go through these in life, so no complaints. The Tsunami word used in the movie was picked up by Kamal after getting an invitation from Gollapudi Maruthi Rao(Telugu film producer/Director who acted in cameo on 2000 film Hey Ram) to institute an award in his sons name who lost his life in Tsunami while shooting for Telugu film Prema Pusthakam (1993 Telegu movie- actor Ajith's first movie). This usage turned out to be a sensation as Dec26-2004 seen real Tsunami in Tamilnadu (Film released on Jan-2003). Overall i would rate this film to be excellent due to its quality. Eternal theme of Humanity on art at it's best","25 December 2006","10/10"
"157","Movie","Anbe Sivam","rameez3000","What a movie this is!?!!Can Tamil movie industry produce such a master-piece?I had this doubt for a long time..Not now!! This movie is above all. Among the usual formula films, this is a rare Gem! The story is not so new, but the screenplay and acting surpasses everything.Anbarasu(Madhavan) is a posh guy who like to be called A.Ars. While looking for a shooting location just 4 days before the marriage in Orissa, he is left stranded there because of the rains and floods. Sivam(Kamalhassan) is a handicap with bruises all over his face and he walks with a limp. He is on his way to Chennai after getting the check for the flood affected people back in Chennai. Circumstances make them both travel together. Anbarasu is extremely irritated with Sivam and he constantly scolds him for advising him far too much. Amidst that, Sivam's flashback unfolds. It is a usual story of Hero-loves-rich-girl-father-doesn't-accept-so-they-run-off.While they do that, Sivam is involved in an accident and thats the reason he has got all the bruises. When he returns back to see Bala(Kiran -his lover), his father Nasser tells him that she is married and settled in America. So Sivam comes off telling that he wont disturb her anymore.Anbarasu slowly begins to like Sivam who helped him come to Chennai safe and sound before the marriage. When he comes to know of his family, Anbarasu is touched. He asks Sivam to be his brother and to stay with him forever. The story goes as though it is going to have a happy ending, but there is a twist. The girl whom Anbarasu is going to marry is none other than Bala. When Sivam sees that, he is shocked. Nasser calls Sivam and talks with him. Sivam promises that he wont tell Bala about what happened only if Nasser signs the papers to increase the monthly wages of the workers in his factory from 910. He does that and the story does not end there. Nasser asks his right hand (Santhana Barathi) to kill Sivam who does not do that because of humanitarian reasons.The story ends there.The theme ""Love is God"" is perfectly brought out through this movie. Kamals acting as the handicap Nallasivam makes us cry at many places. Particularly when he sees his face in the mirror after the accident, tears welling up in his eyes, it makes everyone cry! What an actor he is?Madhavan is a surprise package! He has acted really well in this movie. His angry remarks to Sivam and the way he gets irritated by Sivam's stupid comments make it all the more enjoyable. A special mention about the dialog's penned by cartoonist Madhan (who eventually makes a guest appearance in the movie). The dialog's are both imaginative and powerful, which makes us laugh and at the same time think! Sundar.C, a man known for his comedy movies has made an impression here with his Awesome screenplay! Music rendered by Vidhyasagar is worth a mention, particularly the title song ""Anbe Sivam"" and the duet ""Poo Vaasam"".For the People who love Good cinema, this is a MUST SEE!!:)","22 December 2006","10/10"

"159","Movie","Anbe Sivam","ARUNKUMARD","I happened to see this film which was a perfect blend of philosophy, realistic acting and the fine art of film making. Now, I am not a big fan of Kamal. Never was. The arrogance so clearly etched on his face is a major put off for me. But ever so often, Kamal makes me admit ( albeit grudgingly ) that he is the best at what he does.The philosophy of the film is best explained by the words of the title song, ... A rough translation goes something like this,For the theists, God is love. For the good among the atheists, Love is God.Who here is God ? You and me.The story is written by Kamal as is the screenplay. He has sung a couple of songs as well out of which the haunting title song stands out. Madhavan is but a tool in Kamal's hands which he uses effectively to his advantage.Kamal's character changes from that of a bumbling idiot in the first few scenes to a communist union leader with a artistic vein in the middle scenes to a god like figure in the last few scenes. In the last scene, as Kamal walks away into the horizon, we are left with no option but to stand up and salute the indomitable spirit of a man from whom life has taken away so much but still manages to smile.I wouldn't describe anything more about the story because any words that I can conjure up here wouldn't be enough.

"161","Movie","Anbe Sivam","glitzz97","Before I begin with the film, I want to express a doubt on this site's functionality. Have the critics gone mad? You guys give this masterpiece just a 7.8? This film beats Hollywood films in many ways, trust me. Firstly, the atheism theme in this film is not intended to encourage people to join atheism, but not to misunderstand atheists as they're human beings as well. Kamal Haasan has been highly underrated in most of his films although he teaches us things that we don't learn in the daily screwed up education syllabus. This film teaches us patience, love, honesty, and sincerity. The work of art in this film is undoubtedly wonderful as they're presented in subliminal ways. This film is not a remake of Planes, Trains And Automobiles, but just inspired character wise. This film deserves several Oscars and many other awards as well. Besides that, I really look low upon IMDb in this as films such as The Avengers and Skyfall are overrated despite their illogical film making. Overall: 9.3/10","10 April 2013","9/10"

"163","Movie","Anbe Sivam","SAMTHEBESTEST","Anbe Sivam (2003) :
Brief Review -A decent Hollywood Movie turned into An Emotional Masterpiece and the Greatest Human Drama for South Industry. It's been a long time i had tears rolling down from my eyes while moving towards the entracte part of any Indian Film. Anbe Sivam made it happen with the most simple formula ever possible in human genre and also made it socially intellectual with the reference of God inside every Human being. The film is adapted from Hollywood Comedy 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' (1987) but it has changed the entire theme and meaning of the story by putting emotional content. This is very different from the original film because it just took the basic idea of 2 strangers meeting each other and trapped for couple of days together and rest of the storyline is completely different hence no credit to the original film. Anbe Sivam deals with many things at one time like Communism, Atheism, Goodwill and Humanist values. Kamal Haasan delivers another outstanding performance while R Madhavan holds very well against him. I couldn't resist tears and claps in the climax when i saw that Kamal Haasan doing his Best and even his expressions on his face and those intentional ugly looks doing better than the situations. Some theories told by this film will remain with me for lifetime such as, A real Good Man don't need to look good and the Bad Man can be a good looking guy, God is Love etc. Sundar C's direction is as beautiful as his name. However, there were few low grade scenes which could have trimmed or shot better but since the story is great it all goes behind the curtain. Anbe Sivam is Overall a Masterpiece Storytelling causing a life-changing experience for viewers if you are the man with a good heart and emotions. I always prefer emotions over critic mindset so even if the film had some flaws, i wouldn't mind overlooking them for the sake of Heart-wrenching Climax and those tears i thrown out.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest","23 October 2020","9/10"
"164","Movie","Anbe Sivam","thiru-dinesh","good comments from all the members Following is one nuance from me .. one main lesson that is learnt by madhavan(in the movie) but not shown explicitly is when at first scene kamal tells madhavan that nowadays good looking, learned people commit crimes more than the not-so-good looking ones... When Yugi sethu steals madhavan's belongings madhavan must have learnt this lesson... in fact apart from the hidden nuances of the film which u have pointed out... the film had lot of out spoken details of the society and what kamal as a individual feels about it... Be it the talk about Working for foreigners when they board the train and little details like when he keeps talking about his fathers death in a Tsunami, he dozes half way through it, meaning he has moved on with the fact of life.. and the way he asks madhavan if he goes around daily with thieves when madhavan says he has not seen thief in real!!!! or when he forgives the man in last scene, when he warns about using wet cell phones...But i do not understand 2 things... why wasn't the rebel song and his Umbrella fight commercially famous when nowadays simple fight sequences with no relevance of place or facts get so much news... and i must say that the press and media have not given the credit to the film that it deserved.... in this world of cheap stories and acting... a Kamal film like this still does not get, if not better, equal hype to Rajini's movies... If one is hyped for its commercial value this film should have been promoted for its story value... Even Kamal requires his films to do good at box office and does not want his films to be called out-of-the-world and great!!!!Other wise he too will jump into the gutter that is around him... and of course one well known trivia for all of us is that we all know how much Sundar.C must have contributed ;-) One more thing... It must be a heart break for some but this film has its ""one line"" plot from a Hollywood movie called ""Trains planes and automobiles"" but except the fact that 2 different people are made to travel together due to circumstances and one of them is narrating a story... The idea of atheist, practical, matured man who starts liking the emotional, finicky guy, nasser and kiran's character and also the train scene etc are kamal's own making and the underlying concept of the society is itself very fresh ... SO i hope everyone feels the same way... cos its not a first-scene-to-last remakethanks all hope u all enjoyed my comments","15 August 2006","10/10"

In my opinion it is the best Tamil film in recent times. And one of the best non Mani Ratnam film ever. The socialism is subtle yet clear and the director has handled the movie very well. It will go down as a classic in Tamil movie history. As always with good art films, the movie didn't do very well at the box office but made an impact all the same. Personally, it is my favorite Tamil movie till now and I recommend this to everyone. You will not regret watching this movie.

"166","Movie","Anbe Sivam","ragingbull_2005","This is the second film that I have seen in recent times (the other being Ikiru) that has the power to change the course of the life of its viewer, for the better. Haasan is breathtakingly brilliant in Anbe Sivam (Love is God), even more so in my opinion than his turn in the Godfather-inspired Nayakan. He traverses the entire gamut of emotions and is especially brilliant in the comic scenes. He is master thinker, too, which is evident from the screenplay that he has written. While the script prima facie seems to be a rip off of the classic ""Planes, trains and automobiles"" (""Due Date"" was another recent spin on the same story), the depth that Haasan offers because of the inherent conflict that he introduces in the exchanges between Sivam, who is a communist, a ""comrade"" and Anbarasu, the quintessential child of free market, gives the happenings a rare gravitas, inspite of the comic incidences. And although the love story that plays in flashback runs in a predictable fashion and takes away some of the sheen, it ends in a spectacularly jaw dropping climax that stunned me. Hindi movie audience has been truly unfortunate as we have seen so little of Kamal Haasan. There has been the odd Appu Raja, wherein he blew away with his double act. Then there was the abhorrent ""Abhay"", which could have put an insomniac to sleep. Watching this is a penance that Hindi movie watchers who have berated Kamal Haasan as an overrated actor should perform, at least once. This is available, with English subtitles, on Amazon Prime.","10 March 2017","7/10"

People who are expecting a standard Sunder C Fare with Kiran on it(Like ""Winner "" full of Slapstick comedy, Masala songs and Fights) would return home disappointed.Really it is unbelievable that Sundar had directed this movie and it would be ""THE MILESTONE"" of his career, a movie which he can talk proudly and would be his key for HALL OF FAME.","18 February 2007","10/10"

You don't feel happy nor sad, you do not want to get up from the place, you have this empty kind of a feeling. Anbe Sivam gives you the same kind of feeling. Due to torrential rains both Nalla Sivam and Anbarasu are stuck in orissa with all trains and flights cancelled. The whole movie is their journey from Orissa to Chennai. Anbarasu dislikes and is suspicious of Nallasivam because of nallasivam's looks. But they keep bumping into each other. On the way,Nallasivam teaches some vital lessons of life to anbarasu. The movie is a commentary on the materialistic life we are leading and how real happiness is not achieved from the comforts which you have but is achieved from the respect which one earns from others. Kamal Hassan is brilliant(as always)in getting into the skin of the character. Madhavan, Nasser,Kiran Rathod and all the other countless characters (including the street dog) have all done their jobs perfectly. This movie has a universal appeal which will be appreciated by all.

"174","Movie","Anbe Sivam","braddugg","Love is God. Truth is God. This film stands for love and truth.Titled as Anbe Sivam (Love is God in Tamil) and as Satyame Sivam (Truth is God in Telugu). This movie is about 2 characters Anbarasu (Satyanand in Telugu) and Nalla Sivam (Sada Sivam in Telugu).There is lot to speak about this film but I will put it all succinctly and I would like everyone to watch this film. Go through one of the most profound philosophical journeys of Indian films and it may make you feel happier, my very sincere request for every film viewer.The journey begins amidst floods in Bhubneshwar and ends in Chennai. But how did they make and what have they learnt of each other. How did Nalla get scars on his face and what is love for each of these two protagonists. It questions a lot of beliefs and in fact very authentically answers most of them. Most questions are by Anbe while most answers are by Sivam. There is a lot of metaphor hidden behing every thing in this film. Like the painting, Sivam does in an office. There is lot of hidden meaning which can be interpreted in multiple ways. But this is it, Truth is God and there is no so called God if there are no good humans. There is a god in every good human. Now, what is good, this abstraction is enhanced into objectivity by bringing in situations so important to each.Now, acting is top notch by both and so is music (though it brings in a kind of Enigma feeling). Lyrics, I must say are superb for Tamil and even Telugu versions.I being an atheist, I believe more in human values than in traditions and the abhorrent customs set by our predecessors. I neither value them nor follow them but yes surely, I have highest respect for humans and their peace and happiness.Technically, editing should have been better and cinematography had a lot of scope but camera was used very miserly to enhance beauty of scenes. Nevertheless, since I first saw it. I keep visiting this movie very often (say 2 times a year) and will continue to do so.It's 4/5 for a movie rich in characters and philosophy and even subtle humour. Kudos, to Kamal Haasan, the genius who gave such a wonderful script along with Madan.","20 September 2014","8/10"

""Run"" proved that he could be a successful action hero. This film is a must see, Even if you have watched it for 4 or 5 times !!!!!

The story is not complex, yet it brings you to the edge of your seat at moments.
It is filled with symbolism, especially a scene where it symbolizes that casteism commits suicide. Beautiful.
It doesn't show oppression solely by creating sympathy and showing the oppressed class getting further and further oppressed unlike in some movies. You feel for the hero, you're with him and cheer for him.

"180","Movie","Pariyerum Perumal","chetan_l","This is one of the best Tamil movies in recent times, and is worth every praise that's coming its way.I watched this movie with no idea of what it was about or what to expect. Right from the first frame, the movie looked different, and by the time the first song played out, I was rubbing my hands in anticipation of something out of the ordinary. This movie grabs you by the scruff of your neck, shakes you out of your slumber, and keeps you rooting for the protagonist throughout the run-time. Your soul cries when he is hurt. Your mind gets angry when he is angry. And then, your heart aches when he bears all the torment single handedly, before his spirit gives him enough courage to stand up and fight for what is rightfully his.The fact that there is a very strong message of how casteism maims and kills humanity - literally and in spirit - is brought out inherently, and yet very strongly.Pariyerum Perumal also straddles the line dividing art-house and mainstream cinema without resorting to any formulaic solutions. Direction is top notch, as is the screenplay and editing. The songs are out of the ordinary, and downright wacky at times! It adds to what is already a good movie, making it even better. Art direction and cinematography is again beautiful and brings out the drama on screen very effectively. The production team has used colors and symbolism to match the story intrinsically. The role of Karuppi, the dog, as the flesh-and-spirit companion and metaphor for the hero is commendable.Kathir, as the protagonist, has done a stellar job and is well supported by all the other actors. Marimuthu, Lijeesh, Karate Venkatesan, Anthony Dasan, and others have all played their roles very well, and Yogi Babu adds a comic touch to the proceedings without the comedy track being any way detrimental to the story-telling.The one possible sore point to bring out is the portrayal of the female lead as someone who is very sweet and innocent and is kept completely isolated from all the raging violence and caste oppression. However, that portrayal forms the very basis of the story-line and gels well in the story. In her own way, the heroine is true to her heart and stands up for her beliefs without fear of ostracization or retribution, albeit in innocence. Also, without giving away too much in terms of a spoiler, the Director does not paint every character from the upper caste as being inhumane.This movie is as much about oppression as it is about optimism. Add this movie in your watch-list as a must-see.","8 July 2019","9/10"

"188","Movie","Pariyerum Perumal","SAMTHEBESTEST","Pariyerum Perumal (2018) :
Brief Review -Tamil Cinema is BLESSED to have such a Socially Powerful Classic film. I remember watching Nagraj Manjule's ""Fandry"" for throwing a stone at many issues of the society and then ""Sairat"" for stunning classification of Honour Killing and Casteism. The reason i mentioned these two films is that i have not seen many filmmakers trying to make such cinema in all realiatic manners to showcase brutal reality from lower areas and try to stop it somehow by sending a tight slap through cinematic medium. Finally my wait seems to be ended with Pariyerum Perumal and if i can say so then this is an Intermediate version of those two films yet finding complete originality and credibility of it's own storyline. The film has a heartbreaking and disturbing concept causing anxiety towards how lower cast people bear so much humiliation and torture afterall. A law student from a lower caste begins a friendship with his classmate, a girl who belongs to a higher caste, and the men in her family start giving him trouble over this. This might seem highly repetitive concept but wait.. you have different problems, different conflicts, different issues and different society here to deal with so please try finding something new in it because it is there only somewhere hidden in small small nuances. I literally broke down while watching couple of scenes and some scenes made me jump out from my seat. I mean, it was so connective subject to any common man unless you belong to those evil tribe of inhuman creatures. Acting, writing, cinematography, dialogues, background score, lyrics, direction and overall presentation everything is top class here. I have no complaints to make except for the predictable positive climax being too generous. I think there could have been something stunning, sensational and mind shattering in the final scene which might have left our brain thinking over it for sometime. Rest, it's a Top Quality Classic from Tamil Cinema, yes the same industry who make cheap films in mainstream orientation.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest","8 November 2020","8/10"

"190","Movie","Pariyerum Perumal","ragingbull_2005","Prima facie, because of the IMDb summary, the viewer may end up believing that he is about to see another _Sairat_, story of intercaste love leading to _honor killings_. But the summary does no justice to this.It is a gavel designed to bludgeon societal assumptions about what you can and cannot do, basis the place or the background that you belong to. It is a war cry to never let go of your dreams and ideas.And it contains some of the most vividly disturbing scenes of recent times. These are not especially gory. But, the casual brutality that people indulge in, in the name of caste pride is shown in all its rawness and it is meant to shake you to your insides, which it successfully does.I couldn't make out the original words but the music and the songs , in their translation , are bold and thought provoking.It is *number 2* on the list of Indian films on IMDb. That may be a function of the fan boys ratings but it is truly special. It seems auto biographical at times and would stun you with its directness.The directors next, _Karnan_, is even better.Very highly recommended.","8 August 2021","8/10"
"191","Movie","Pariyerum Perumal","arunbvijay-vijay66","Pariyerum Perumal, by the young filmmaker Mari Selvaraj, is one of the best Tamil films about caste discrimination and the suffering of the oppressed. This is highlighted because it is not a preaching and the filmmaker did not trust the message in his face. Mari Selvaraj has visibly described the cruel practice that exists in society and has let the public make the final decision.
The film begins with a group of young people from the oppressed community who move around a pond in the village after another gang of the upper caste has approached the same place. A member of the oppressed community said that they should fight hard against the opposite side, but his friend said that nothing would change until they stop working under the superior caste. Then, we witness the brutal murder of Karuppi (dog) Pariyerum Perumal (Kathir), who belongs to the lower caste. Later, we learned that the director Mari Selvaraj establishes an analogy between Karuppu and Pariyerum Perumal.
If Kathir's character has been represented as the face of all the youngsters from the oppressed community, there is an old man who executes honor killings as suicides and deaths, he has been portrayed as the face of the heartless animals in the society. 
Kathir has given his heart and soul to the film, some of the scenes where he gets beat up look very real. There are scenes where Kathir addresses important topics on oppression but it doesn't sound preachy mainly because of his realistic performance and solid writing of Mari Selvaraj. 
Anandhi looks pretty and homely as a small town girl, there is a brilliant emotional scene in the pre-climax where she scores extremely well as a solid performer. The old man who comes as the pride upper caste guy who converts honor killings as murders and suicides is menacing and create shivering moments. There are many shock values in Pariyerum Perumal, the death of the dog, the scene where Kathir gets beaten up and the revelation of his dad.","5 October 2018","10/10"

"198","Movie","Pariyerum Perumal","sudheeshthulaseedharan","The politics of human skin color, cast and sexuality is harder and harder to execute than this. In a nutshell, this is Mari Selvaraj's Pariyerum Perumal.Through the story of Perumal, who was born in a lower caste went to study at a law college in Tirunelveli in 2005 with the desire to reach great heights through education. The film shows us how the caste system brutally interferes in his daily life.When he forgets that he is living as a dalit, the film depicts that we are still living in a caste system where he is convinced on many occasions that he is just a dalit.The film puts forward the life truth that he is not responsible for the murder of his beloved dog Karuppi, the bullying at his classmate's wedding house and the ridicule he got from college, but that he cannot escape from it, even though he realizes that the real problem is his caste.Kathir has put on a show of extra ordinary acting to the best of his ability. In other words, there are many scenes where he cannot express his anger but when you see all of them, it seems that Kathir's is a career best performance.There is another important character. A character who kills very easily for the sake of the caste. It was done by someone over the age of 60 but the character is really terrified.Santosh Narayanan's BGM was good.This uncompromising quality movie is a never ending proof that the Tamil film world is still moving in a different direction from realistic cinema.","7 February 2021","8/10"

The amazing climax, featuring Shobana's spectacular dance with her partner, pushes this movie from a simple Malayalam thriller to the level of high art. Although the film isn't perfect--there are minor plot holes, and Mohanlal's entertaining performance goes over the top in some scenes--Manichithrathazhu is one of the best Indian movies I've seen.After watching this movie, I couldn't believe it was directed by Fazil, the same guy who churned out overly sentimental mush like Aniyathi Pravu (1997) and shameless, cookie-cutter Hollywood remakes like Life Is Beautiful (2000). Manichithrathazhu has to be the high point of Fazil's career.After a lifetime of avoiding most Malayalam movies like the plague, old classics like this film are turning me into a big fan of Malu films. Also, after watching his charismatic performances in films like Nadodikattu (1987), Pattana Pravesham (1988), Akkare akkare akkare (1990), and Manichithrathazhu, I find myself becoming an enthusiastic fan of Mohanlal.

"206","Movie","Manichithrathazhu","anupasokan","One Excellent masterpiece. This is one of the rare movies where the story can be interpreted in two ways. One way is to believe that Ganga is possessed by Nagavalli the dancer's spirit. The other is to assume that she is suffering from multiple personality disorder. The movie has arguments for both. The psychiatrist's explanations and predictions and his ability to solve the problem leaves most of the audience believing in the MCD theory. But Nagavalli fans point to the famous dance scene where Ganga's eyes change colour, and the scenes where she breaks objects like the clock which seemed quiet impossible to most. This reinforces the possession theory. Probably this is the first Indian movie to feature MCD. Highlights of the movie are the scene where Ganga gradually evolves into Nagavalli and her Malayalam changing into chaste Tamil, and the bharatanatyam dance sequence. It also has an unique song sung in a sad tone: 'pazham thamizh pattu'. Urban legends say the song's vaadi raga is unlucky, almost like gloomy Sunday and macbeth. Although made more than 13 years ago, it still glues you to the seat. two remakes were done on the movie. the kannada version was good though it didn't match the original. A tamil version was poor and twisted.","25 May 2006","9/10"

"208","Movie","Manichithrathazhu","Vibijithnair","One of the greatest thriller ever made in India & also among my most gratifying movie ever i had seen. No doubt story by Madhu muttam is the real hero & performance by all actors were magnificent especially Shobana(won national award). Shobana was scintillating & showcase a do or die performance. 1st half is enriched with comedy & little horror. 2nd half is nail biting taut thriller leads to fiery climax. There is no point in criticizing this masterpiece despite of its length. Music was both nostalgic & horrifying(climax). BGM by Johnson is brilliant which taken film to another dimension. Performance,Script,Music,Bgm,Cinematography,Direction,Make-up and Art department etc. were par excellence. Manichitrathazhu is one of the rare thriller which provide wholesome entertainment to the viewers in large quantity. There is no unnecessary scene and so its a 100% Impeccable masterpiece ever an Indian cinema produced. After premiering on T.V many times i never get bored watching again & again. Highly Recommended for thriller aficionado and also for avid moviegoers.=>MUST watch before die. =>Dont watch its remake version all were just mockery repercussion!I would like to rate it 9.5/10","1 January 2014","10/10"

Malayalam movies are always ahead of the rest of the country in making meaningful and realistic stories. That too on quarter of the budget a Bollywood movie is made with. This movie was a masterpiece work from Fazil. This movie also had another 6 A list directors doing diff segment of this movie, like the comedy part was done by Priyadashan. This movie was later made into a Tamil, Kannada and Telungu all which turned out to be super duper hits. Plans are in the pipeline to remake it in Hindi. But the essence of the movie is being lost in the translation. The 1993 Malayalam version is the best yet. This movie was well made and well received my all the generations of Keralites.

Its a horror movie with a scientific view given to it and never got deviated from concept of science to a ghost movie. The movie maintains its pace and mentioned earlier, Shobana's work should be praised as it was at a different level, something which Indian cinema never ever witnessed till date.

"218","Movie","Manichithrathazhu","SAMTHEBESTEST","Manichitrathazhu (1993) :
Brief Review -Manichitrathazhu expands the limits of Psychological-Horror-Thriller genre not only for Indian Cinema but also for Global Cinema. Suppose we are all in the year 1993, and try to understand this review as per the time and then you'll understand it perfectly and it won't even sound like an exaggeration. By 1993, Hollywood had One Classic Psychological thriller made, that's 'Silence Of The Lambs' (1991) and even that film does not have any unexpected revelations in the climax like Manichitrathazhu. Hollywood had stunning climaxes in Psychological Thriller genre with 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Fight Club' but these films came after 5-6 years of Manichitrathazhu. The same applies to Foreign Language Cinema (except for Bergman's Persona in 1966) and Indian Cinema. Just try to remember what kind of thrillers India was making or Hollywood was making by 1993 and then have a look at this Cult Classic Malayalam Flick. Manichitrathazhu truly is an pioneer of this new genre where horror elements are mixed up with Psychological Thrilling elements and the cumulative result of it leaves each an every viewer amazed, shocked, scared and boggled. What a cracking storyline it was for its time. Who would though of such a groundbreaking script then? I mean people were happy to see just a thriller or a psychological drama or a horror film and then Manichitrathazhu came up with a combined effects of all of them. OMG! There is not a single wrong thing in the film. The humour, the writing, the acting, the overwhelming ideas, stunning visuals, impeccable direction and what not. The film has been remade multiple times for a reason, right? Just prefer the original and this is certainly the Most Stunning Experience in the entire 90s decade. A cinematic sensation beyond filmmaking limits of contemporary global cinema.RATING - 8.5/10*By - #samthebestest.","3 June 2021","10/10"

"221","Movie","Manichithrathazhu","Jithindurden","This must be the most played movie on Malayalam television and definitely the movie that I have watched the most number of times. A comedy and psychological horror at the same time with some of the greatest performances by the most charming ensemble cast. The film is still being studied as one of the best Malayalam films and more and more studies on the details of the film is being made every year. Rewatching with the knowledge of the twists (honestly I can't remember if I ever didn't know the twist growing up with it), there are a lot of small details that clearly foreshadows and hints at everything happening and going to happen it throughout the film. The music in it immediately brings me to that world and makes me comfortable there. Even with a lot of the details that can be considered complex it has a simplicity to it. Mohanlal being playful as Dr. Sunny and brings all his charm to it along with some of the best comedic scenes by Innocent, Ganeshan and KPAC Lalitha makes it so refreshing even after all the rewatches. This is one of those films that I love even more with each rewatches even when it is playing in TV every other week.","26 February 2022","9/10"
"222","Movie","Manichithrathazhu","vivekkrishnang-971-989423","The story of this movie is very unique and has not been told before. First we thought it is a supernatural story, but as we understood the dual personality of Shobhana we got very interested in this character and how she would be able to get out of her predicament. The characters in the movie, Sunny Joseph, Nakulan, Ganga, Ammavan are all memorable and have been portrayed with realism.Even though this is a ghost movie, there are no special effects. Director Fazil uses simple tricks like shadows on the wall and sounds to heighten the tension. In one scene, the whole family goes to watch a Kathakali performance. Sunny sits in the front and occasionally turns back to see if Ganga is alright. The sound of the drums heighten in the background. Then, once when Sunny turns back, there is silence and Ganga is not there. The intensity of the scene is heightened by the lack of any background sound, which we thought was a very innovative but subtle technique.In this movie, the script by Madhu Mattom is the hero and Shobhana is the heroine. Shobhana had two roles, one as the mild mannered Ganga and the other as the revenge seeking Nagavalli. It during the Nagavalli phase that you see her transformation, in her voice and in her mannerism. Shobhana won a truly deserved National Award for this role.Mohanlal makes his entry just before the interval, which is unconventional. From that point onwards, it is his show and the character he portrays is that of a fun loving psychiatrist. He is unconventional in his treatment style also. Mohanlal does not have much histrionics in this movie and plays a very subdued role.For a movie which is a psycho-thriller, it has excellent comedy provided by Innocent, Lalitha and Mohanlal himself.The story, screenplay and dialogue is by Madhu Mattom and we liked all three of them. There are no unnecessary scenes in this movie and each scene in the screenplay sustains our interest in the story. We also are impressed by the craft of director Fazil for making this movie very interesting. The movie also had a second unit by directors Sathyan Antikkad and Priyadarshan. M.G.Radhakrishnan has provided some memorable music for this movie. All the songs are nice to hear, but our favourite is Palavattom Pookalam This movie is one of our favourites and is a must watch.","10 April 2014","10/10"
"223","Movie","Manichithrathazhu","AvinashPatalay","I have been trying to get hands on the original version for a few years now and finally succeeded. Even though ""Manichithrathazhu"" came out in 1993, the screenplay and performance go in tandem to keep the audience in rasp attention. The plot starts off as a horror, enter Mohanlal it turns to light-hearted comedy and finally culminates as an intelligent thriller. Shobana and Mohanlal would be the only reason you would want to watch ""Manichithrathazhu"". Suresh Gopi is okay in the role of loving and caring husband though the characters gets classified as a subdued (and gets relegated to back-seat the moment the doctor enters the house). Fazil must be feeling quite proud that his baby is garnering enough curiosity and interest. And given that it is being remade in Tamil, Hindi & Kannada speaks volumes by itself. Obviously the technology has jumped several hoops in the past decade and obviously the newer versions are expected to be sleek & superior (melodramatic is the right word actually). Yet ""Manichithrathazhu"" has its own distinct flavour and was indeed ahead of its time.","22 July 2010","10/10"

"226","Movie","3 Idiots","planktonrules","It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film.","2 June 2011","10/10"

Serious, sad and silly, often concurrently but overwhelmingly very, very funny and engaging, as engineering students at an Indian college end up teaching as much as they learn. Who could disagree with the distinction between education and learning while recognising the often sizable gulf that exists between the two after watching this. Who would dissuade those with aspiration and passion from pursuing their dreams and goals.

That life is not actually a race; reveals that this is imposed on us by the education system. Rancho, our character who opposes the order at every opportunity, cannot make sense of not talking about new ideas but grades at schools. Because he goes to school to learn, not for a diploma, he gives importance to knowing the meaning, not memorizing, he does not say ""what I learn at school stays at school"", he applies what he learns in daily life. The secret of its success; Reading the part he is passionate about.","3 August 2021","9/10"
"232","Movie","3 Idiots","StevePulaski","""All is well,"" the three ""idiot"" heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.But all is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike any one I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce.Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas ""Rancho"" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.One of their problems in college is the professor/dean of the campus, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who the three derogatorily call ""Virus"" when his back is turned. Virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students, which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldn't dare cross paths with and that is the issue of Indian teen suicide. One kid had his father have a stroke, rendering him unable to focus on academics for months, falling gravely behind. Virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case, denying him an extension on a project he's work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfect.If anything, we can say 3 Idiots is a message to the parents of the Indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic. I've read several articles articulating the point that Indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates, and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure, duty, and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse. You're given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose, but not every method is perfect, and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide, mental health problems, and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers, then you may want to reevaluate your methods.3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of ""living through a person"" that I can imagine.The film runs ten minutes shy of three hours, which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable. I was skeptical myself walking in rather blind. Almost every Bollywood film I've conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours, some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours. If other Bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable, human, and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class, I can't see it being a struggle to get through any of the industry's films.Through every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen.","3 January 2013","10/10"
"233","Movie","3 Idiots","MOscarbradley","The title may conjur up images of the 3 Stooges and the crude humour of the opening might suggest a Hindi ""Porky's"" but with a running time of almost three hours ""3 Idiots"" clearly has its mind on higher things. It's a Bollywood buddy-movie devised as an epic and determined to outdo all the competition and being a Bollywood movie is full of large-scale musical numbers as well as a lot of very broad and very funny comedy.The 3 idiots of the title meet as engineering students, become life-long friends but are separated by that old fickle finger of fate. It's also bold enough to deal with such issues as suicide and poverty and, of course, the caste system and is lifted onto an altogether higher plain by a terrific performance from Aamir Khan as 'the idiot' the other two worship and who, naturally, isn't an idiot at all but the sharpest tool in the box and he's brilliantly supported by Sharman Joshi as his potentially suicidal friend and Omi Vaidya as his number one rival. Brilliantly directed by Rajkumar Hirani this is the kind of film Hollywood could learn a lot from and which, had it been a Hollywood film, might well have swept the boards come Oscar time.","26 September 2020","10/10"

Like a lot of Americans, my knowledge of Bollywood was based entirely on film clips and American take-offs of lavish musical numbers.I searched a few lists of top Bollywood films and settled on 3 Idiots, which turned out to be a wonderful decision. The movie is terrifically funny and engaging, seamlessly moving from comedy to tragedy to musical numbers.The story centers around a brilliant, iconoclastic technical student who spends the movie telling people to follow their dreams. While generally lighthearted, the movie strongly addresses the apparently terrible stresses on Indian college students. But in spite of some dark moments, overall this is about as feel-good as you can get. Feel-good to an absurd degree? Sure. But what's so bad about feeling good?When I think of Bollywood I think of big musical numbers, and there are a handful here, although they're a tiny part of the three-hour running time. Still, they are tremendous fun.To sum up, I saw a Bollywood movie, I laughed, I cried, and now I want to see more.UPDATE: I saw more. So many good movies out there!","20 September 2017","9/10"
"237","Movie","3 Idiots","deloudelouvain","Because the movie had such a high rating on IMDb I was intrigued. Bollywood movies are not particularly on the top of my list I must admit. But I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. It only has two scenes where they start singing and dancing so that was not too much. Why they start singing and dancing that I will never get. The story does not need that at all. The story itself was very pleasant to follow. Full of mixed emotions, happy ones and sad ones. The cast and the filming was great. All actors gave a good performance throughout the whole movie. Like in most American television series they want to give you a lesson in life and most of the time it makes me want to barf but in this Bollywood movie it works perfectly well. I had fun watching this and I get why I am not the only one. Certainly worth a watch.","6 February 2016","7/10"
"238","Movie","3 Idiots","sumanbarthakursmailbox","I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post.","24 December 2009","10/10"
"239","Movie","3 Idiots","classicsoncall","Never would I have thought that a movie that looked this stupid on paper could have turned out so good. Just looking at the DVD cover would have been enough to turn this film back in but it shows up in IMDb's Top #250 so I thought I'd give it a try. It didn't start out that well for me but before long the movie's magic began to take hold. Not that there's anything daringly new about it's message; it all has to do with believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life after one's formal education is completed.Aamir Khan is a potent anchor for the story of three college friends attending the Imperial College of Engineering, and Rancho's ideas about success don't revolve around getting the best grades but actually learning something. I could see somebody like a younger Matthew Perry performing the role if this was an American film. I wasn't really expecting as much in the way of music from this story, but with the amount of song and dance you could almost call it a musical. The 'Zoobi Doobi' dance number was quite infectious and looked like a lot of fun.Another thing that keeps you engaged is the non-linear story telling technique. But the thing is, you never really get confused when the time line changes from ten years ago to present day. With all the humorous situations presented, this could have easily fallen into slapstick, and it did get close at times, but then the story pulled back with a poignant message or a sobering decision one of the characters had to make. Story threads are tied up that one forgets along the way and that's another cool element. I just thought it was a uniquely creative film with a neat twist at the end with the identity of Rancho. There's even a romance thrown in for our principal player, and when it was over, I had the feeling that this is what ""La La Land"" could have been but never came close.","2 November 2017","9/10"
"240","Movie","3 Idiots","vvv832","As many ordinary Chinese high school students,who have to study fourteen(14) hours every day for the college entrance examination in the final year,I was entirely shaken and moved by ""3 idiots"",sharing the same feeling with all the students from high schools and universities in China(or Asia). O(∩_∩)O Compared with mainland China,India is lucky,having less corruption in education system.This film is incredible inspiring,especially for those who are struggling or ""survived"" in high schools and colleges.I read some reviewer,some doubt whether suicide in the film is logical,which is really DISAPPOINTING! (—__—!)If you experience the life in poverty areas in Asia,you will understand what a significant role the higher educations play in their lives. Burdening great pressure from family and society,they attach great expectation and significance to the enrollment of colleges,and they intend to abandon poverty by getting higher education.Diploma means everything for them. Thus,the plot where the man committed suicide after lost the chance to graduate is reasonable.","19 February 2011","10/10"
"241","Movie","3 Idiots","vivee003","Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to ""Five Point Someone"", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that ""chase excellence and success will follow"".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...Verdict : THE BEST of 2009 !

"242","Movie","3 Idiots","ironhorse_iv","In a country, where over-achievement is expected & anything deem a normal life is look upon as the idiotic or lazy failure. A lot of Asians feel, that slaving away, their lives, for the chance of extraordinary wealth is the only way, to live, even if it's does not suite their personality. Indeed, the hunger for success and wealth is so engrained in Asian culture, that it's hard to escape, such burdens. It's true, that Asians societies, do put extreme pressure on its members. Often, weighting down on them to a point, that some people feel, that it's too much; causing them to common suicide. So, I can see, why people would want to see this film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It has a more healthy and positive approach when it comes to a country's wants and don't wants, when it comes to the individual member. Set in an India academia world, 3 Idiots revolves around three students studying in the Imperial College of Engineering, in New Delhi. The first idiot, Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) comes from a poor family and is desperate to pass and get a good job, but lacks the self-esteem to go with his plans. The second idiot, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), comes from a relatively better family, but has joined engineering to please his family, while he really wants to become a wildlife photographer. The last idiot, Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchhad (Aamir Khan) is a radical-thinking young man, who more willing to challenges the educational system at every step he takes, rather than accenting the harsh-crude teaching practices of the college, often infuriating the headmaster of the school, Viru 'The Virus' Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). However, Farhan and Raju lost contact with Rancho after graduation. Ten years later, Farhan gets a call from an old enemy colleague of theirs, Chature 'Silencer' Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) who says he has found Rancho. Abandoning everything, Chatur, Farhan and Raju set out on a road trip, to find him. But all is not as it seems. Can the idiots find their friend or will the search end up as a wild goose chase? Watch the movie, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to look at the film, in a western world view set and say, the Animal House style college scenes, far out-live the present day, road trip movie. I really felt, those scenes were far, more effective, even if the social message was somewhat too broad. I like that, the modern day teaching standards are called into question. It made a very interesting film. Sadly, the movie takes the often funny yet brilliant Patch Adam like, school challenges, and mixed it, with below average Bollywood film dramatics. The movie often moves into such clichés, that it become somewhat emotional jarring to watch. One minute, you're listening to a Bollywood musical dance number, and then, you cut to an emotional, over the top preachy death scene. The pacing for the film is all over the place. It really drags at times. Some of the film's greatest twist comes inappropriate mistimed. You'd know that Raju will survive his suicide attempt since he's alive and well in the present day scenes. You know, that the men will end up, being successful, regardless, what the Virus pull onto them. Don't get me wrong, the twist about Racho's past was pretty good, but the film was pretty predictable. Then, there are the unrealistic over the top scenes that are absolutely nearly implausible in any universe, like the whole stubborn baby scene. Anyways, the acting, throughout the film was pretty good. Each character had a moment to shine. My only problem with the acting is Kareen Kapoor as Pia. She was so disappointing, most of the film. I really don't get her character. Why would she still go after, Suhas (Olivier Lafont), after three-times, where characters warn her, not to!? It doesn't make sense. Plus, that noise ring, she wore, during the film was so distracting. Another thing that kinda hurts the film is the songs. Shantanu Moitra's score is a bit too gimmicky. The song, Zoobi Doobi sounds entertaining, but sounds too similar to other Bollywood songs. The song 'All Izz Well' sounds like it should had been, put in the credits than in the middle of the film. Anyways, I love the over-the-top childish humor. While, the jokes are simple and old. They work mostly within the means of the story. Chatur's engineered speech is by far, the funniest scene in the film. Still, the movie does seem, a bit, one-sided when it comes to condone misbehavior. I'm deeply surprise that the three men, wasn't kick out of the school, within the first couple of minutes in the film. Much of the film's controversy, comes from the fact, that the movie is loosely based on the novel, Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhaget. Any fan of the book, would know, that the film is way different. The suicide message of the book, get somewhat lose in the film. Yes, within the last five years, India has one of the greatest absolute numbers of suicides cases, but here is where the movie get some of the information, wrong. Other countries have the highest rates, overall. It's also untrue, that extreme pressures of academia cause most of India's suicide rates. Farmers are more likely to kill themselves, versus any other professions in India, as list by the World Health Organization. Despite that, the film is fun for the most part. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people. The cinematography is beautiful to look at. I love the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh. The film felt like a typical masala film. It's good to eat, but a bit too spicy, at same moments. No wonder, why this film is one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films ever. Overall: While it's kinda overrated. It's emotional, entertaining and enlightening. In my opinion, it was a somewhat above averaged Bollywood film.","11 August 2015","8/10"
"243","Movie","3 Idiots","Kicino","I missed it during the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival and am really glad it is released publicly.Haven't seen such a feel good movie for a long time. Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie, intertwined with some teary scenes: all is well if you follow your passion; chase excellence and success will follow; be brave and follow your dream; think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success – that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dream/passion.Excellent acting, colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves, not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship, love, family and playful/stressful campus life.Every student, teacher, and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes : ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking."" ""Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."" Both Steve and the Rancho character (Aamir Khan) are smart and creative, nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.Just go see it. You won't regret it.","2 September 2011","9/10"
"244","Movie","3 Idiots","NpMoviez","This particular movie is my most favorite movie of all times. I don't even know where to start with. I have definitely watched over 600 movies in my life, and this happens to be the only movie which was able to have a positive impact in my life. Long story short, I have been in the place of each of Rancho, Fahran and Raju in my life. And I have always applied the principles this movie introduced whenever I have been in a tough situation. I have learned to follow after excellence rather than success. I have learned to follow my passion and care less about what society thinks about my decision.Rajkumar Hirani has always addressed a certain issue and/or has boldly hit many lame principles and ethics of the society with a perfect satire. In this movie, it's about the cliched belief that if you're a science student, then it has to be either medical science or engineering if you want to get successful. In the real world, many people have been a victim of this belief and have wasted their life. Had they not been brainwashed by the society, they would've had a better life. That's what the movie justifies and as per my experience, it makes a whole lot of sense. Another thing is, you need to worry about excellence. If you are excellent, the good grades are almost obvious. And in the end it's your excellence that matters, not the grades.Hirani tells the story in his own unique way. Just like in every single one of his movies so far, he crancks up everything to 11 to make sure that his point has reached to the audiences' mind. Many of those cranck ups do not make sense in real life, but that does not even matter because the movie doesn't want that particular cranck up to be relatable. But it does want whatever that cranck up tries to tell to be relatable. And it succeeds in that. And whether or not it makes sense or not, you'll get the point and a great dose of laughter. And there are some of the sequences which are just hilarious and over the top, and are meant just for the sake of laughter. The characters are very likable and quite different from one another. Each of them are a representative of the kind of people there are in the society and in the academic field.The movie doesn't make all kind of sense if you look at it quite literally. Even I would say it's quite nonsensical if I am to look at it literally. But it's meant to be looked at literally. Many scenes are mere representation of something else that the story wants us to know. With that regards, it's pretty good. Even if you watch it at the face value, you won't be bored at all. There will be a build up to something, and the final result will be exactly the opposite of what you expected and that will make you laugh a lot.The songs are pretty good. They aren't the strongest part of the movie by a long shot, but are still popular than many recent Bollywood songs. It's strange that a late 2000s movie had songs which are still popular. Every single actor have given their best performance till date.Rating : absolute 10/10, Grade : golden A+","30 April 2021","10/10"

He's a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. Maddy excels, he's astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. Sharman Joshi is good, yet again. Omi is a Masterstroke. A surprise packet, his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! Kareena is weak. Boman Irani is mind-blowing as the vicious head.

I went with my family and watched the first-day-first-show and was I pleased ? In one sentence - The best Bollywood movie ever ! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.As you can understand, they could not bring the name of any IIT into the movie to avoid disputes. But trust me, whatever they have shown about the life in IITs, it's all true. Right from suicides, cold-hearted Professors to lack of encouragement and support for talents who can really bring serious change in this world. The movie successfully depicts how once inside, your life is only about meaningless grades, go get into the race before it's too late.Take my free advice and avoid any reviews or words from people who have already seen the movie. Don't let anyone spoil any scene from the movie. Rush to the nearest theater and experience the phenomenon for yourself. You'll bless me for this advice !","25 December 2009","10/10"

"248","Movie","3 Idiots","DICK STEEL","When I told a friend that 3 Idiots is the best film this festive period, he told me it takes an idiot to be able to tell one, and that I saw myself in the film. If anything, I'll take that as a compliment, as the film is about self-actualization, or the simple fact that it's a wake up call in this rat race of a world that we live in, that we lose sight of things that matter in the pursuit of success. It's a wake up call that we should be pursuing Excellence instead, which in the work environment one gets easily drowned in mediocrity, or blind faith that success follows without putting in too much hard work.Set predominantly in the varsity days and told in chunks of flashback, this film will allow you to reminisce about a time where life was nothing but exams, lectures, and that paper chase, either making the grade or having to repeat. But there's also probably that one person, or a few if you're lucky, whom you'll meet on campus that will help you directly or indirectly, shape your outlook, thinking and just about forming long lasting bonds, whose interaction with will shape your character just before entering the workforce.3 Idiots tell of such a friendship, amongst 3 buddies Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi), two mediocre students who just scrape through, and the one huge influence in their lives, ace student Rancho (Aamir Khan), the livewire of the trio who irks the Dean of Imperial College of Engineering (modelled after the famed Indian Institute of Technology), Professor Viru (Virus), played by Boman Irani. In fact, it's something like a Hindi equivalent of the local I Not Stupid with its critique on the educational system, but done with a lot more finesse, fun and without sledgehammering its ideals down your throat.The gist of the disparity here is the concept of learning how to learn, or teaching somebody how to fish compared to just giving the students the fish. It's a reminder that knowledge gathering goes beyond just doing so for exams, and the techniques of blindly cramming will do one not much good later on. It's about the application of knowledge for the real world than to answer papers, and the joy of acquiring such knowledge. It's the 3 Idiots versus the Professor, and their peer Chatur ""Silencer"" (Omi Vaidya who played the role with glee, as the peer bootlicker that everyone loves to hate) who throws down the gauntlet to Rancho as to who will eventually be the more successful of the lot.What made 3 Idiots work remarkably, is the excellent chemistry between the leads. Aamir Khan, the big name as he is, doesn't upstage his co-stars R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi, as their characters get into various forms of shenanigans in college. Instead they complement one another in their roles, and thanks to makeup, look very much comfortable as their aged selves, and their younger teenage ones through closely cropped hair, and outfits. Aamir aces the role of Rancho as the boy who gets ahead of the pack without really trying and at times being perceived as both the smarty pants and the troublemaker of his cohort, though his sudden disappearance after graduation has made his good friends try to track him down, albeit unsuccessfully. The film also doesn't take itself too seriously when the time calls for it, switching quite playfully to ramp up its funny moments, even at times breaking the fourth wall when telling the story of Raju's background (in black and white melodrama no less). The jokes here worked wonders as well, as do the couple of twists that roll along in the 2nd act after the interval, which is somewhat telling of the narrative depth that the film possessed. Songs were breezy and plenty of fun, and I personally enjoyed Aal Izz Well (All Is Well) best, a chant that the Idiots adopted from Rancho, who uses it to calm his heart when it's filled with anxiety and fear. I think it works.Affairs of the heart though are kept at a bare minimum, when Rancho falls for the daughter of Professor Viru, Pia (Kareena Kapoor). While they start off in quite testy terms, things start to thaw when Pia sees Rancho for who he is, except that the secret Rancho keeps threatens to keep them permanently apart. And that is unless the other 2 pals could help it in their quest to locate Rancho. Everything falls into place at the end, especially telling of the second act when you learn of this secret at the cliffhanger prior to the interval, and this provides yet another emotional sucker punch to your gut when themes like friendship lasting forever starts entering the picture.Chase excellence and success will follow; this film lived up to that tagline in being one of the most excellent I've watched this year. Amongst all the film offerings put out this festive season, my choice for the most uplifting, the most hopeful and a jolly entertaining ride all around with elements of everything only a Bollywood film is renowned for, is this one. Don't miss it, and it goes directly, albeit a late entry, as a contender for my top films of the year!","26 December 2009","10/10"
